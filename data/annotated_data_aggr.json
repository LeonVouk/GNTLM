            "early_life": "Vedder was the Class of 1969 valedictorian at Canajoharie High School, Canajoharie, New York, and a 1973 graduate of Swarthmore College.\nVedder worked in Africa for the Peace Corps from 1973 to 1975. There she and her husband William Weber (Bill) worked in a small boarding school in rural south central Zaire. She taught the girls there by reminding them \"You're special -- don't ever forget that\". One day they asked her why she changed her name to her husband's if she believed everyone was special. She then decided to change her last name from Weber back to Vedder upon returning to the United States. Her time in Zaire inspired her interest in wildlife conservation. This feeling intensified at Zaire's Kahuzi-Biega National Park where she observed Casimir, an enormous male eastern lowland gorilla. This encounter made her want to work with wildlife in Africa after the Peace Corps.\nIn 1975, Vedder returned to the United States where she began searching for a graduate school where they could launch her career in wildlife conservation. She and Bill chose the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. From one of their graduate program's classmates, the couple learned about British primatologist Richard Wrangham who recently visited Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park. In October 1977 they met Dian Fossey in Chicago, where she accepted their research proposal and set a tentative date for their arrival in Rwanda.\nIn 1978 she arrived in Rwanda with her husband to study gorillas at Karisoke, the research station run by Fossey. They arrived right after poachers has killed a mountain gorilla named Digit who was famous due to Fossey's research. The couple had secured research funding from the Wildlife Conservation Society. There she tried to nurse a wounded gorilla named Mweza back to health but did not succeed. This experience left her and Bill angry. With that anger, they chose to focus on ways to help the gorilla population. Amy followed Gorilla Group 5 and wrote down everything they ate and where. This information helped her figure out the type of habitat and how much the gorillas needed. After six weeks of following the group, the gorillas started to accept her presence for longer periods of time. She took notes on a specific gorilla in the group each day, noting how often and what the gorilla ate.\nAfter getting a doctorate at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1989, she became Biodiversity Coordinator for the Wildlife Conservation Society, and later director of the conservation of the society's Africa Program.\nOne of Vedder's contributions was to implement the Mountain Gorilla Project (subsequently the International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP)), which sought to involve local Rwandans and use ecotourism to help conserve the gorillas.\n",

        "Eddie_Vedder": {
            "early_life": "Vedder was born Edward Louis Severson III on December 23, 1964 in Evanston, Illinois, to Karen Lee Vedder and Edward Louis Severson Jr. His parents divorced in 1965 when Vedder was an infant. His mother soon remarried to a man named Peter Mueller. Vedder was raised believing that Mueller was his biological father, and he went by the name Edward Mueller for a time. Vedder's ancestry includes Dutch, German, and Danish on his mother' side (Vedder) and Norwegian on his father's side (Severson).While living in Evanston, Vedder's family fostered seven younger children in a group home. In the mid-1970s, the family, including Vedder's three younger half-brothers, moved to San Diego County, California. Vedder received a guitar from his mother on his 12th birthday, and began turning to music and surfing as a source of comfort. He especially found solace in The Who's 1973 album, Quadrophenia. He said, \"When I was around 15 or 16...I was all alone\u2014except for music.\" His mother and Mueller divorced when Vedder was in his late teens. His mother and brothers moved back to the Chicago area, but Vedder remained with his stepfather in California so he did not have to change schools.\nAfter the divorce, Vedder learned the truth about his parentage and that Mueller was really his stepfather, not his father. Vedder met his biological father briefly as a child, but was led to believe that Severson was merely an old friend of his parents. By the time Vedder learned the truth, Severson had died of multiple sclerosis. During his senior year at San Dieguito High School, Vedder moved out to live in an apartment, supported himself with a nightly job at a drug store in Encinitas. Because of the pressure of work and school, Vedder dropped out of high school. He joined the rest of his family in the Chicago area, and changed his last name to Vedder, his mother's maiden name.\nIn the early 1980s, while working as a waiter, Vedder earned his high school GED from Oakton Community College.\nIn 1984, Vedder returned to San Diego with his girlfriend Beth Liebling and his friend Frank. While living in the San Diego area, Vedder recorded demo tapes at his home and worked various jobs, including as a contracted security guard at the La Valencia Hotel in La Jolla. Vedder had several stints in San Diego area bands, including Surf and Destroy and the Butts. One of those bands, called Indian Style, included future Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave drummer Brad Wilk.In 1988, Vedder became the vocalist for Bad Radio, a San Diego-based progressive funk rock band. The band's original incarnation was influenced by Duran Duran; however, after Vedder joined, the band moved to a more alternative rock sound influenced in part by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\nVedder attended San Dieguito High School, now called San Dieguito Academy, and donated proceeds from a 2006 Pearl Jam concert in San Diego toward the construction of a theater for the school in the name of his former drama teacher, Clayton E. Liggett. Liggett was Vedder's mentor in high school. Vedder wrote the song \"Long Road\" (from Merkin Ball) upon hearing of Liggett's death in 1995.While living in the basement of Pearl Jam manager Kelly Curtis' house in Seattle in the early 1990s, Vedder was roommates with Alice in Chains guitarist and vocalist Jerry Cantrell. Vedder was also friends with Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, and wrote the song \"4/20/02\" (from Lost Dogs) on the night that he found out about Staley's death, on April 20, 2002 (though Staley had actually died over two weeks earlier on April 5, his body was found on April 19). Vedder also paid tribute to Staley during a Pearl Jam show in Chicago on August 22, 2016, which would have been Staley's 49th birthday; \"It's the birthday of a guy called Layne Staley tonight, and we're thinking of him tonight too. 49 years old\", Vedder told the crowd before dedicating the song \"Man of the Hour\" to his late friend.In 1994, Vedder married Hovercraft bass player Beth Liebling, whom he was dating since he was a teenager, circa 1984. Vedder was Hovercraft's drummer during their opening slot for Mike Watt's U.S. tour in 1995. The couple divorced in September 2000. In an interview published in the June 29, 2006 edition of Rolling Stone magazine, Vedder said that his divorce from Liebling had devastated him. The divorce happened around the same time as the biggest tragedy of Pearl Jam's career, when nine fans were crushed to death during the band's set at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark on June 30, 2000. In an interview with Chris Cornell's daughter Lily in 2020, Vedder explained that their show started on a high because they had just been told about her birth, until about 40 minutes into their performance when the tragedy happened. Vedder revealed that Pete Townshend helped him through the early stages of dealing with the tragedy.On September 18, 2010, Vedder married his longtime girlfriend, model Jill McCormick, whom he had been dating since 2000. They have two daughters, Olivia, born in 2004, and Harper, born in 2008. In 2011, McCormick appeared in the music video for Vedder's solo single, \"Longing to Belong\". In 2014, Vedder and McCormick co-founded the EB Research Partnership, a non-profit organization dedicated to finding a cure for the genetic skin disorder epidermolysis bullosa. They have raised over $25 million to fund research to find a cure.Vedder was a close friend of the late Chris Cornell, the Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman. Aside from Vedder's Pearl Jam bandmates, Cornell was one of the first people Vedder met after moving to Seattle in 1990. The two were neighbors for a while and shared vocal duties in Temple of the Dog. In the 2009 book Grunge Is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music, Soundgarden manager Susan Silver recalled that Cornell carried Vedder onstage on his shoulders at Pearl Jam's second show in Seattle (the band was known as Mookie Blaylock at the time): \"Everyone was still reeling from [Andrew Wood]'s death... The band came on and Chris carried Eddie onto the stage \u2013 he was on his shoulders. It was one of those super powerful moments, where it was all a big healing for everybody. He came out as this guy who had all the credibility in the world \u2013 in terms of people in Seattle \u2013 and Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone were loved bands. Andy was such an endearing personality. It was a hard thing to do \u2013 to show up after people die. And Chris bringing Eddie out, and pointing at him, as much Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready recalled that Cornell had helped welcome the \"'super, super shy'\" Vedder to Seattle: \"He was like, 'Hey, welcome to Seattle. I love Jeff [Ament] and Stone [Gossard]. I give you my blessing\". From then on [Vedder] was more relaxed. It was one of the coolest things I saw Chris do'\". In a 2009 interview with Uncut magazine, Vedder stated that Cornell is \"the best singer that we've got on the planet\". About the impact that Cornell had in his life, Vedder told a crowd in Alpine Valley before performing \"Hunger Strike\" with him in September 2011; \"I had no idea how he would affect my life and my views on music and my views on friendship and what a big impact he would have. These guys [the other members of Pearl Jam] know him much longer than me and his impact is profound\". The friendship between Vedder and Cornell is featured in the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty. During his solo concert in London on June 6, 2017, Vedder talked for the first time about Cornell since his death on May 18, 2017, saying that \"he wasn't just a friend, he was someone I looked up to like my older brother\" and \"I will live with those memories in my heart and I will love him forever\".Vedder is a friend of The Who guitarist Pete Townshend, who discouraged Vedder from retiring in 1993. In late 2007, Vedder wrote the foreword to a new Pete Townshend biography, Who Are You: The Life of Pete Townshend. The book was published in the UK in March 2008 and in the U.S. in October 2008. Vedder was a close friend of the late Ramones guitarist Johnny Ramone, with Vedder being at his side when he died. Since Ramone's death, Vedder and Pearl Jam have played the Ramones' \"I Believe in Miracles\" regularly at live shows. While driving home from Ramone's funeral, Vedder wrote the lyrics for the Pearl Jam song \"Life Wasted\" (from Pearl Jam).While surfing with Tim Finn in New Zealand on March 25, 1995, Vedder was carried 250 feet (76 m) off the coast and had to be rescued by lifeguards. He also has paddled outrigger canoes on occasion and in 2005 was nearly lost at sea trying to paddle from Moloka'i to Oahu.Vedder has written songs and lyrics that question religious authority. Vedder is a Chicago Bulls and Chicago Bears fan and a long-time, die-hard fan of the Chicago Cubs. In November 1993, Vedder and White Sox pitcher Jack McDowell were involved in a barroom brawl in New Orleans, Louisiana that resulted in Vedder being arrested for public drunkenness and disturbing the peace. Vedder sang the national anthem before the third game of the 1998 NBA Finals in Chicago, and has sung \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" at six Cubs games, including Game 5 of the 2016 World Series. In 2007, a few days before performing with Pearl Jam in Chicago for Lollapalooza, he threw out the first pitch at Wrigley Field, the home of the Cubs. Vedder wrote a song at the request of former Cubs shortstop and first baseman Ernie Banks paying tribute to the Cubs called \"All the Way\". The day after the Cubs won the 2016 World Series, the Cubs' official Twitter account posted a montage video backed by Vedder's song in a tribute to Cubs fans.The annual series between the Seattle Mariners and San Diego Padres is often nicknamed the Vedder Cup due to both cities being hometowns of the singer.The singer is also a great admirer of the late American science fiction author Kurt Vonnegut. During an interview with Uncut Magazine, he stated that the novel Cat's Cradle is his favorite book of all time.\n",

Her mother tongue is Kannada.\nEarly in her career, she was involved in modelling assignments and did a notable advert for biscuits alongside prominent actor Suriya. She was subsequently approached by Arjun to essay the lead role in his production Madrasi and Vedhika accepted the role. Her role went largely unnoticed due to the film being based around Arjun's action image, with a critic labelling her performance as \"adequate\". After the release of Madrasi, Vedhika went on to sign a big budget Hindi language film, Jai Santoshi Maa, a remake of the 1975 film of the same name, but the film failed to subsequently materialize and Vedhika continued acting in South Indian films. She went on to feature in Raghava Lawrence's comedy horror Muni, but her role was minimal once again and the film went to become an average grosser commercially. Her maiden Telugu venture was in Vijayadasami, a remake of the Tamil film Sivakasi, where her performance was described as \"okay\" and \"average\" by critics.Her first release in 2008, the Silambarasan-starrer Kaalai, received negative reviews and became a commercial failure. However, the film became notable for the dance number, \"Kutti Pisase\" with Vedhika's dancing being critically appreciated. She went on to appear in a second successive film which was panned by critics and which became a financial failure with a role in Sakkarakatti. The long-delayed film featured Shanthnoo Bhagyaraj making his debut in the lead role and A. R. Rahman providing the soundtrack, however Vedhika's role was described as one of the sole positives from the project. Later that year, she starred in a Kannada film, Sangama opposite Ganesh, and the film fetched her good reviews for her performance. In 2009, she appeared as the radio jockey Anjali in A. Venkatesh's Malai Malai with the film consequently going on to become a success commercially. The film had little scope for Vedhika and reviews cited her role as \"pure eye candy\" whilst claiming she was \"apt\" for the role. She made a comeback to Telugu films in the same year, with a role in the critically acclaimed Baanam. Her role won her plaudits, whilst her on screen presence with Nara Rohit was praised with a critic citing she gives \"good company as the na\u00efve girl\" and it is \"refreshing to see them together\". After the release of Baanam, Kumar went on a sabbatical and did not sign any other films until, despite making an appearance in a notable advert with Karthi for mobile company Airtel.

            "early_life": "Aida Vedishcheva was born in Kazan (administrative center of Tatar ASSR) in the doctor's family of scientist, professor of dentistry Solomon Weiss and surgeon Elena Emelyanova, who arrived from Kyiv just before World War II. In 1951, the Ministry of Health offered professor Weiss to open faculty of therapeutic dentistry in Irkutsk, Siberia. There, Vedishcheva finished her School and Music School.\nAfterwards (by her parents' request), she enrolled into the Pedagogical Institute of the foreign languages, where she studied both the German and English languages and at the same time she was performing in the student theater of the musical comedy. Upon graduating from the institute, Vedishcheva left for Moscow, to fulfill her dream of becoming an actress-singer. She tried to enroll into the Mikhail Shchepkin Higher Theatre School but failed. After that, she began her singing career due to her strong and beautiful voice.\nAida Vedishcheva began her singing performance career in the early 1960s, in Orel State Philharmonic Society. Vedishcheva sang in the famous jazz orchestras of Oleg Lundstrem and later of Leonid Utyosov orchestras. From 1966 on, she was performing along with the \"Meloton\" ensemble as well as the Vocal-instrumental ensemble (VIE) \"Blue Guitars\" led by Igor Granov. The same year (1966), Vedishcheva became a laureate of the First \"All-Union Competition of Soviet Song\". She achieved the national recognition after singing \"Song About Bears\" in 1967 for the movie Kidnapping, Caucasian Style (seven and a half million records were sold). The song from the movie-musical \"Red, Blue, Green\" (1967). In 1968, for the song \"Geese, Geese\" (\"Gusi, gusi\") she received a diploma at the Sopot International song festival (the Polish Baltic Sea coast). That was followed by such songs/movie soundtracks as \"Volcano of Desires\" (\"Help Me\") for the movie The Diamond Arm (1968), the soundtrack for the movie \"White Piano\" with the song \"I'll Wait for You\", \"The First Spring\". With the song \"Comrade\" (1970), Vedishcheva won the 1st prize on the competition at the Moscow radio station \"Youth\". The record of this song was sold by millions by the record firm \"Melodia\" and became the hymn of youth of 1970's. The next hit from Aida came with \"Forest Deer\" from the movie Way to go Nastia!\". These popular songs of Ms. Vedishcheva has been sold by firm \"Melodia\" in circulation of 30 million copies. \nDespite her great success among the listeners, she met numerous obstacles from the Soviet officials. One of the reasons was the anti-Semitism politics of Sergey Lapin, the chairman of All-Union Radio as well as her unauthorized performance in Sopot Festival shortly after the events of the Prague Spring (after which she was blacklisted by the USSR Ministry of Culture). Among such obstacles there were cases when her name not making into movies' credits, prohibition of concert tours abroad, even cancellation of concerts, cold receptions on television, erased tapes with her recordings on the radio. For example, her song \"Forest Deer\" was recognized as the Song of the Year, but on the television instead of Aida it was performed by Loktev ensemble. From the mid-1970s on, Vedishcheva's name disappeared from the credits of some movies and cartoons. In 1980, she finally left with her mother and son to the New York.\nIn New York, Vedishcheva had to start her singing career from the ground up. She enrolled in Brooklyn College, taking a course of theater program, where she studied American history of Hollywood, Broadway, cinematography, and dance. At first, Vedishcheva resided in New York City, then she moved to Los Angeles. In the US she was able to receive recognition, creating her own theatrical One Woman Show, performing at Carnegie Recital Hall, Avery Fisher Hall of Lincoln Center and other venues under the pseudonym \"Amazing Aida\" (that's how she was called by the press of Miami, Florida). At that time her repertoire included: numbers from the popular Broadway musicals and Hollywood movies as well as the great hits of French composer Michel Legrand, her Russian hits, as well as Jewish folk songs.In the beginning of the 1990s, Aida Vedishcheva was diagnosed with stage III cancer. Despite doctors' precautions, Vedishcheva insisted on her surgery and went through chemotherapy - treatments to which the disease yielded.In 1998, Vedishcheva put on the show Miss Liberty for the new millennium. After the September 11 attacks she wrote the musical \"Masterpiece and the singing Liberty\" and dedicated it to the Statue of Liberty. The musical was performed on Broadway in 2007.In 1985, she moved to Los Angeles. In 2001, her biography was included in the Historical Book \"Who is Who in Russian Speaking California\", Copyright 2001 American Russian Business Council, Control Number 2002100217.\n",

From 1992 till March 2008, he worked for various law firms in Ukraine (as a partner of Magisters from 2006). In March 2008 Vlasenko was appointed deputy head of the State Tax Administration of Ukraine.\nIn 2007 Vlasenko became a member of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party. in the 2007 parliamentary elections he was placed at number 170 on the electoral list of  the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc and was not elected into the Ukrainian Parliament. In June 2008, Vlasenko became People's Deputy of Ukraine and a member of the faction of the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc. After he left the post of deputy head of the State Tax Administration.Vlasenko is Yulia Tymoshenko's lawyer in the various court cases against her (since 2010).Vlasenko was placed at number 20 on the electoral list of Batkivshchina during the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election. He was re-elected into parliament. Vlasenko is a member of Batkivshchina.On 21 January 2013, Vlasenko stated that he stood accused of car theft, robbery and failing to obey a court ruling stemming from his divorce several years ago. On 5 March 2013, this investigation was \"closed for lack of crime\". As of 13 March 2013, Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating the allegations of Vlasenko's former wife that he beat her; as a result of this, Vlasenko can not leave Ukraine.On 28 February 2013, Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Volodymyr Rybak inquired to the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine on depriving Vlasenko of his seat in parliament because he continued to engage in other than parliamentary activity. Vlasenko claimed his legal license was annulled and he was no longer engaged in any extra-parliamentary activity. On 5 March 2012 European Union (EU) Commissioner for Enlargement \u0160tefan F\u00fcle and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton called on the Ukrainian authorities to address this situation so as to avoid creating any perception of misuse of the judiciary for political purposes. The U.S. Department of State agreed with the EU on this and added the case appeared to be politically motivated due to Vlasenko's connection with Yulia Tymoshenko. The Higher Administrative Court annulled the parliamentary mandate of Vlasenko on 6 March 2013. \u0160tefan F\u00fcle considered this \"not European way\" the same day.On 4 March 2014, the Verkhovna Rada returned a deputy mandate to Vlasenko, and Speaker Oleksandr Turchynov said that \"according to a Higher Administrative Court ruling of February 28, 2014, Vlasenko is a people's deputy\".

            "early_life": "After training to be a ballet dancer and also exploring the American dance tradition, Vo-Dinh expanded her learning experience at the Merce Cunningham School in New York. Back in France, she danced with Fran\u00e7ois Raffinot from 1991 to 1996. In 1997, she founded the Sui Generis company. She was noticed early on for her distinctive style.\nIn 1999, she was awarded a Villa Medicis Hors-les murs grant for her research in creating Texture/Composite, for which she was awarded the Prix d\u2019Auteur at the Rencontres chor\u00e9graphiques internationales de Bagnolet in 2000. The piece was subsequently presented at Danspace Project in New York in 2002. Since then her productions have been presented on a regular basis both in France and abroad. In January 2012, Vo-Dinh became the director of Le Phare, Centre Chor\u00e9graphique National du Havre Haute-Normandie, ushering in a new artistic vision that has reached out to a diversity of choreographic styles.\nVo-Dinh's wide-ranging choreography has been shaped through the process of creating new work. While she initially focused on choreographing in a more formal way, her methodology gradually evolved toward an open-ended process affording a prominent role to improvisation in the studio. Surrounded by close collaborators, Vo-Dinh works with her performers on a long-term basis.\nSeveral pieces have been deeply rooted in scientific and anthropological research on human beings, romantic relationships, absence, the lack of emotion and schizophrenia. The art world has also informed her work: between figurative and abstract in the visual arts, as well as in the relationship between bodies in motion and the music of Beethoven, Dusapin, Zeena Parkins or G\u00e9rard Grisey. Although the choreographic structure often draws on minimalism to the point of repeating and transforming a single motif, Vo-Dinh has mainly focused on time, how it is perceived and its relationship to memory and memories. After a long absence, fragmented narration has surfaced in her latest pieces \u2013 a new approach to time and point of view, as well as to the body and how it relates to others.\nVo-Dinh readily accepts invitations, including Rainbow, her piece for amateur dancers in collaboration with David Monceau, and her work with the writer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mauche for Concordanse. Beginning with Histoires Exquises in 2011, she has invited choreographers to create solos from oral testimonies, the starting point for opening up the creative process to audiences. That willingness to share and her curiosity about other approaches to dance were to be the leitmotif in her vision for the CCN du Havre. Since 2012, Vo-Dinh has endeavored to make Le Phare a platform for many different kinds of choreography \u2013 during key moments such as the Pharenheit festival, as well as throughout the year, bringing the CCN to life in order to showcase dance in all it vibrancy.\nSince 2014, she has been the president of the Association des Centres Chor\u00e9graphiques Nationaux, a network comprising nineteen national choreographic centers in France. Vo-Dinh was awarded the insignia of Chevalier de l\u2019ordre des Arts et des Lettres in July 2014.\n",

Her song \"It's Only Life\" was featured in the MTV series Newport Harbor: The Real Orange County.In 2004, Voegele released her second extended play, Louder Than Words. The extended play, as well as her previous one, helped further draw interest in Voegele as an artist. The album featured songs from her first album, as well as a new song titled \"Better Days\". That same year, Voegele's song \"Only Fooling Myself\" won the Pop category of the 2005 USA Songwriting Contest, the youngest artist ever to win the honor in any category.

Anderson asked if Voegele was signed, and later asked her to meet him. She later signed with MySpace Records, a branch of Interscope Records. On the event, Voegele stated \"I thought it was a fake message. I mean does Tom really even exist, let alone go on MySpace and send messages to random people? But sure enough, it was totally legitimate, and the next week I was out in LA meeting and showcasing for him. [...] I was so excited because from the start I knew MySpace Records was different than other labels I'd been to. I felt immediately comfortable and I could tell I would be given a lot of artistic freedom there.\"\n",

As a child, she discovered her grandfather's violin in the attic of the family home, and began to learn to play. Nurtured by family members who each played a variety of instruments, she frequently joined in playing in the family concerts in the living room, now saying in retrospect \"We were cheerful and awful.\"\nDiscovering in secondary school that the violin could be played in rock music and other genres of music opened up new possibilities, and encouraged her to continue practicing her craft. It was during this period that Voelz found a used acoustic guitar for $25 and learned to play it, although the violin never ceased to be her primary instrument.\nAfter graduating high school, Voelz majored in English and in Music (Violin), graduating from Indiana University. After relocating several times, she found herself living in what had become a college town with a thriving mecca for artists during that time: Austin, Texas. She began playing and performing with musicians she met there, including Ronnie Lane, who had relocated to Austin with former bandmate Ian McLagan, both of Small Faces/Faces fame. They performed in a short-term band dubbed the Seven Samurai. During this period, she found opportunities to perform as a backing musician with others on tour, including John Mellencamp and Alejandro Escovedo. Voelz was offered work by the Hawaiian band Poi Dog Pondering, who had relocated to Austin and were searching for a fiddler for their planned debut album. The combination clicked, and she has now contributed to 13 albums with the band.Voelz has worked composing music and assembling film scores for movies, documentaries and educational tools. She composed the score for the Frontline television series The Lost Children of Rockdale County, which won the Peabody Award, as well as the follow-up Merchants of Cool. She also worked on projects for PBS educational documentaries.Traveling as a sideman with a variety of musicians, working as a session musician in the studios, Voelz has performed with numerous famous performers, and continues to do so.\n",

He received his Abitur in Munich in 1953, and began studies in political science, history, sociology, and economics, first in Heidelberg and then in Munich. He received his doctorate in 1960, while working as a research assistant at the Institute of Political Science at the University of Heidelberg. He became a lecturer there the following year, also working in adult education.\nIn 1963, Vogel was elected to the municipal council of Heidelberg, but resigned two years later, following his election to the Bundestag. He joined the governing board of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany in the Rhineland Palatinate in 1965. From 1965 to 1967, Vogel was a member of the German Bundestag, a position from which he resigned to assume the job of State Minister of Culture and Education in Rhineland-Palatinate under Minister President Peter Altmeier. He continued in the same cabinet position under Altmeier's successor in 1969, Helmut Kohl. In 1973, when Kohl became chair of the national CDU, Vogel succeeded him as state party chair in Rhineland-Palatinate.\nIn December 1976, Vogel became Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate to replace Kohl, who had been elected a federal deputy. Vogel immediately assumed the presidency of the Federal Council until 31 October 1977, at the same time becoming chairman of the supervisory board of the Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF), Germany's second largest public broadcaster. In the regional elections of March 1979 he maintained a bare majority of his party, with 50% of the vote and 51 regional deputies out of 100. In March 1983 the party improved its position, obtaining 52% of the vote and 57 deputies. Vogel became vice-president of the European Democratic Union (EDU) in 1985 and again won the regional elections on 17 May 1987 but with only a plurality of 45.1% of the vote and 48 deputies elected out of 100, ending the sixteen-year absolute majority of Christian Democrats. Vogel's failure to be re-elected as state chair of his party in 1988 led to his resignation as Minister President in a famous speech which he ended with the often-quoted phrase: \"May God protect Rhineland-Palatinate!\", an unusual display of public piety by German standards.\nAfter his resignation, Vogel concentrated on the management of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, of which he became chairman in 1989. After the resignation of the first Thuringian Prime Minister Josef Ducha\u010d 1992, Vogel became Minister-President of Thuringia on 5 February. From 1993 to 1999 he was chairman of the Thuringian CDU. He gave up the chairmanship of the Adenauer Foundation in 1995. 1994 CDU and SPD formed a grand coalition. In the 1999 elections, the CDU achieved an absolute majority. For reasons of age, Vogel resigned from office as Minister-President on 5 June 2003. His was followed by Dieter Althaus.\nFrom 2001 until 2009, Vogel served again as president of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Berlin.\nIn 2012 Vogel was awarded the Mercator Visiting Professorship for Political Management at the Universit\u00e4t Essen-Duisburg's NRW School of Governance. He gave both seminars and lectures at the university.Vogel was nominated by his party as delegate to the Federal Convention for the purpose of electing the President of Germany in 2022.\nVogel is a devout Roman Catholic.

After the war, Tito's communists took his home, including the family piano, and imprisoned his father and brother. Jazz came to symbolize freedom. In 1951, when he was 14, his family was granted political asylum in the United States, arriving in San Francisco. The young pianist began listening to KJAZ radio, hanging out at record shops, and frequenting clubs to hear Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Dizzy Gillespie, and Bill Evans. He heard and performed with John Handy and Brew Moore with he later began his professional career. At the Black Hawk club he met Cal Tjader and Vince Guaraldi, who agreed to engage him as his only piano student. Guaraldi featured Vuckovich in a two-piano quintet, Powder Keg, and sent him to substitute as accompanist for vocalists Irene Kral and David Allyn. When Mel Torm\u00e9 came to San Francisco, Vuckovich became his first-call pianist.\nHe began an association with Jon Hendricks that included performances in the musical Evolution of the Blues and two Hendricks recordings.

Although it may be argued that a major methodological interest of the Baroque hypothesis lies in its very imprecision, his book, \u00c9pist\u00e9m\u00e8 baroque: le mot et la chose (Hermann, 2013) provides a new theory for a concept which JC Vuillemin associates with the epistemological breakdown Europe experienced in the wake of the emergence of Modern science. As a conceptual framework in which poetics, politics, and epistemology interact, his conception of the Baroque is much less aesthetic than purposefully philosophical. According to JC Vuillemin, Sapere aude  ('dare to know') should be the motto of the Baroque.\nJC Vuillemin collaborated to the first critical edition of Jean Rotrou\u2019s complete theater (Belles-Lettres / Sorbonne-Paris-4, 1998-2019) and he published in 2017 an on-going annotated digital bibliography: Jean de Rotrou: bibliographie critique [1]. Vuillemin collaborated as well to the first Dictionary of Seventeenth-Century French Philosophers (Thoemmes Press / CNRS; trans. for Classiques Garnier). In addition to his book on Baroque episteme, he wrote one book on Rotrou\u2019s dramaturgy (Baroquisme et th\u00e9\u00e2tralit\u00e9), three critical editions of Rotrou's plays (L\u2019Hypocondriaque; L\u2019Innocente Infid\u00e9lit\u00e9; La Belle Alphr\u00e8de), and he has authored many articles, book chapters, and reviews. He frequently lectures on both sides of the Atlantic. In his latest book, Foucault l'intempestif (Hermann, 2019), JC Vuillemin revisits and clarifies some key concepts of the so-called \"pens\u00e9e Foucault,\" and pleads for the emergence of a \"post-Cartesian\" subject whose discourse (logos) will be congruent with his or her actions (ergon).\n",

In 1990, Wead was given an honorary degree from Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\nIn 1979, Wead gave a speech titled \"The Compassionate Conservative\" at the annual Charity Awards Dinner, and tapes of the speech were later sold at corporate seminars.In 1992, Wead was the Republican candidate for U.S. Congress in Arizona's 6th congressional district, despite having lived in Arizona for only two years. Wead won the Republican nomination by proposing a tax limit and airing a television commercial featuring praise by former President Ronald Reagan for his humanitarian efforts. The Democratic nominee, Karan English, received the endorsement of former Arizona Senator and 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater, who noted her 22 years of residency in the state. Wead countered that Goldwater's support of abortion rights spurred the unexpected crossing of party lines. He lost the general election to English.\nWead was an active participant in the 2000 United States presidential election, receiving some credit for George W. Bush's victory in the Iowa straw polls of 1999. Time magazine called Wead an insider in the Bush family orbit and \"the man who coined the phrase 'compassionate conservative'\", which George W. Bush picked up in 1987 from Wead.Wead was a senior adviser to the Ron Paul 2012 Campaign, and the Rand Paul 2016 campaign.Wead wrote the 2019 book Inside Trump's White House: The Real Story of His Presidency, published November 2019 by Center Street, an imprint of Hachette Book Group. The book made headlines when it claimed that the Obama White House held \"Political Correctness\" meetings. Former Obama administration members denied this, and responded that Wead was likely referring to the \"Principals Committee\" meetings of senior national security and Cabinet members. Wead confirmed that this was so, and blamed his false assertion on \"a misunderstanding between him and his source\".\n",

            "early_life": "Wealands was born in Darlington, County Durham. As a boy he played for Star Juniors, moving on to Darlington Cleveland Bridge. At 17 he signed professional forms for Wolverhampton Wanderers, but was unable to break through to the first team, and in 1970 moved back home to join Darlington in the Fourth Division. After 18 months he was transferred to Second Division side Hull City. He established himself as first choice goalkeeper a year later, and starting from the 1973\u201374 season missed only three games in four years. Injury restricted his appearances in the next season, when Hull were relegated to the Third Division.In July 1979 Wealands joined Birmingham City, then in the Second Division, for a fee of \u00a330,000. His first season at Birmingham saw them promoted to the First Division. He kept 16 clean sheets and was chosen Player of the Year. He kept his place as first choice goalkeeper, despite competition from promising youngster Tony Coton, and played more than 100 games before a difference of views with new manager Ron Saunders saw him out of contention. He joined Manchester United as cover for Gary Bailey, initially on loan, in 1983, and was an unused substitute in the 1983 FA Charity Shield, but a recurring back injury restricted his chances. Periods on loan at Oldham Athletic and Preston North End preceded his leaving the Football League altogether to join Altrincham in the Alliance Premier League (soon to be renamed the Football Conference).Wealands' first season at Altrincham brought considerable success, culminating in a trip to Wembley where the club beat Runcorn 1\u20130 to win the 1985\u201386 FA Trophy. In that season's FA Cup, Altrincham reached the Third Round and were drawn away to Birmingham City, still in the First Division and still managed by Saunders. Wealands helped his new club become only the second non-league team to eliminate top-flight opponents on their own ground when they won 2\u20131, a result which gave the player considerable personal satisfaction, and which was followed two days later by Saunders' resignation. The next season Wealands helped the club reach the final of the Cheshire Senior Cup. He then had a spell at Barrow before returning to Altrincham in 1988. The last of his 273 games in all competitions for the club was in 1992, by which time he was 41 years old.After finally retiring from playing, he served briefly on the board of Altrincham, and has coached goalkeepers at Bury. In his early days with Altrincham he worked in insurance, and later was involved with a property development company.\n",

            "early_life": "Kelly Wearstler was born in 1967 in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and raised in Myrtle Beach. Her father was an engineer and her mother an antique dealer. Her mother's interest in design had a major influence on Wearstler from a young age. She would come home from school to find rooms often painted new colors. When they were young, Wearstler and her older sister would accompany their mother to thrift shops, auctions, and flea markets, which helped develop Wearstler's early interest in fashion and design. She started collecting vintage clothing at age 15 and later attended the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, where she took architecture classes, and obtained her bachelor's degree in interior and graphic design. While paying her way through college by waitressing, she held internships at the design firms Cambridge Seven Associates in Boston and Milton Glaser in New York.Wearstler moved to Los Angeles in her mid-twenties, hoping to work in the film industry as a set decorator. In 1992 she was a production assistant on HouseSitter, and the following year she served as an uncredited assistant art director on So I Married an Axe Murderer. After working small roles on several sets she decided not to pursue a film career, though the experience did lead to an interior design commission from a film producer. While working as a hostess at a Beverly Hills restaurant in 1994, she was scouted by a Playboy photographer and was featured as September Playmate of the Month under the name Kelly Gallagher. She used the money from the photoshoot to pay off student loans and help start her interior design business.\nIn 1995 Wearstler opened Kelly Wearstler Interior Design, her own design firm. The following year she was introduced to real estate developer Brad Korzen, who hired her to design his house in the Hollywood Hills and several residential properties owned by Korzen's company Kor Realty Group.  The first of the residences was the Avalon hotel in Beverly Hills, which re-opened in 1999 with a style described in the press as \"a playful take on mid-century modernism.\" With apartments filled with pieces from modernist artists such as Arne Jacobsen, Eero Saarinen and George Nelson, The New York Times would write a decade later that \"her playful, elegantly over-the-top designs for the Avalon Beverly Hills changed the look of boutique hotels around the world.\" In 2000, she designed the small Maison 140 hotel in Beverly Hills.Her work on the Avalon and the Maison 140 led to a commission designing Viceroy Hotels and Resorts, a new chain of boutique hotels, which she gave an \"almost theatrical\" Hollywood aesthetic.  The Viceroy in Palm Springs became \"her most accomplished work\" in 2001, and the design of the Viceroy that opened a year later in Santa Monica also earning praise in the press. By that time she was also working on the Viceroy Miami, and other notable designs include Viceroy Anguilla on the island of Anguilla and The Tides Hotel South Beach in Miami. Elle Decor  would later write that \"her luxury hotel interiors\" featured \"elegant berg\u00e8re chairs, unexpected lacquer finishes (glistening lemon yellows, Amazon parrot greens) and old-style stately wallpapers.\"  As of 2002 she had also completed design projects for clients such as Mercury Records, Ben Stiller, and Jeanne Tripplehorn. In 2006 Wearstler designed the restaurant and lounge, BG Restaurant, at the Manhattan Bergdorf Goodman department store.\nHer clothing is no longer sold at Bergdorf Goodman or related retailers, as Wearstler no longer has a fashion collection, instead focusing on furniture, lighting, textiles and accessories sold at her flagship store and website. She continued to operate her Los Angeles boutique as of July 2015, with Architectural Digest writing at the time that the store \"showcases the breadth and daring of her creative output.\" The store contains antique and modern pieces, as well as home furnishings and jewelry designed by Wearstler.As of 2015 she was involved in a number of collaborations and designing lamps with the Italian furniture company Kartell.

Opined Wallpaper*, \"all the pieces are imbued with personality. From the brushed copper through to the walnut that coats the inside of the furniture pieces, a particular ardour resides in the wares.\" In June 2016 Wearstler launched a new bridal registry featuring designer products for the home. Also in June 2016, Elle Decor named her to its A-List of the world's best designers for the second year in a row.

Garbutt, co-founder of Famous Players-Lasky, which later became Paramount Pictures. At one point, the house was also owned by Carroll O\u2019Connor.In March 2020, Wearstler became the first instructor to teach the interior design course on the MasterClass platform. In 2021, Wearstler collaborated with Farrow & Ball to create her own collection of signature paint hues inspired by the state of California, called the California Collection.In March 2021, Wearstler also designed a virtual garage to commemorate the launch of GMC's Hummer EV, which she said was imagined for LeBron James.In 2021, Wearstler invested in the company Block Renovation, which provides a technology based platform that helps homeowners and contractors to digitize and simplify the home renovation process. In early 2022, she became an investor and partner of the female-founded tequila brand Casa Del Sol, which was co-founded by actor Eva Longoria. In June 2022, Wearstler also became an angel investor in the startup Vergo, a Fintech company that caters to the architecture, design and building industry.In 2022, Wearstler took over Wallpaper magazine as a guest editor for their October 2022 issue. The magazine also did a special 20 page feature on her studio\u2019s design work and evolution. In the same year, she partnered with Amazon on their Amazon Influencer Program where her products will be available on her Amazon Storefront.Inspired by the strides in LED technology, Wearstler in 2022 designed a new line of designer lighting for Visual Comfort called Tech Lighting.\nWearstler and her husband, Brad Korzen, married in 2002 and have three sons. The family has remodeled and sold a number of houses in Southern California, including the former Beverly Hills estate of film producer Albert Broccoli, which they moved into and renovated in 2007. Continuing to work primarily out of Los Angeles, as of 2015, Wearstler and Korzen maintained homes in both Malibu and Beverly Hills. Wearstler is active on social media, and in early 2014, Architectural Digest included her on a list of 15 Must-Follow Designers and Architects on Instagram.

Her father taught printing at a local high school and published his daughter's early works. As a child, she enjoyed reading Dr. Seuss and Langston Hughes. Continuing to pursue creative writing as a hobby through high school and college, she later earned her M.F.A. from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and an M.A. in publication design from the University of Baltimore. Although a Baltimore native, she now resides in North Carolina and teaches composition and children's literature at Fayetteville State University (FSU). Initially, Weatherford was invited to FSU as a writer-in-residence, but in 2007, she received the position of associate professor.As an author, she acknowledges her calling \"to mine the past for family stories, fading traditions and forgotten struggles.\" The books she writes, in poetry and prose, explore African-American history from a children's perspective and relate the past to new generations. Her works are often inspired by true events, many of which took place in the areas where Weatherford has lived. In her Author's Notes for each book, she includes a portion of the historical research from which her fiction or poetry emerged. In describing her purpose for writing to School Library Journal, in a 2008 interview, she said: \"I want the books that I write that are set during the Jim Crow era and the Civil Rights era to nudge today's kids toward justice. We've gone a long way, but we still have a long way to go.\"In 1995, Lee & Low Books published her first picture book, Juneteenth Jamboree, about a summer celebration in memory of the Texas Emancipation. She then wrote a series of board books for preschoolers. In 1998, she co-authored Somebody's Knocking at Your Door: AIDS and the African American Church, and then published a collection of poetry, The Tar Baby on the Soapbox. After establishing herself as a versatile writer for both children and adults, she published two nonfiction chapter books before penning her first award-winning children's book, The Sound That Jazz Makes (2001), a poem that traces the history of African-American music.\nSince then, she has continued to write poetry, historical fiction, and nonfiction biographical works for children. She said in a 2008 interview that one of the most important poems she has written was Moses: When Harriet Tubman Led Her People to Freedom: \"Those inspired words came together with Kadir Nelson's soulful paintings and Ellice Lee's brilliant art direction in a perfect publishing storm. Moses propelled my career to another level.\" Moses has won a Caldecott Award for illustration, as well as an NAACP Image Award for an Outstanding Literary Work for Children, and became a New York Times bestseller.\nIn 2008, Weatherford published her first poetic novel for young adults, Becoming Billie Holiday, about the development of the artist who she refers to as her muse.\nIn 2020, Weatherford published Box: Henry Brown Mails Himself to Freedom which was named a Newbery Honor Book.Her book Unspeakable: The Tulsa Race Massacre, illustrated by Floyd Cooper and published by Carolrhoda Books, won both the Coretta Scott King Illustrator & Author awards in 2022.

            "early_life": "Weatherford was born in Ojai, California and raised in Los Angeles. She studied visual arts and art history at Princeton University, graduating in 1984. After graduation, she lived and worked in New York where in 1985 she was a Helena Rubinstein Fellow in the Independent Study Program of the Whitney Museum of American Art.  She returned to Southern California in 1999 and later received an M.F.A. from the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard College. Early in her career she also collaborated with her late sister, the writer Margaret Weatherford, on performance art and worked as a bookkeeper for the artist Mike Kelley.A career breakthrough came in 2012 with Weatherford's Bakersfield Project exhibition at the Todd Madigan Gallery at California State University at Bakersfield where she was an artist in residence. The Bakersfield paintings marked the first time she incorporated illuminated neon light tubes into her abstract paintings. The series was inspired by the colourful neon signs she saw on old restaurant and factory buildings while driving around Bakersfield.Weatherford used neon in the Bakersfield Project and later series of paintings, such as Manhattan (2013), Los Angeles (2014) and Train Yard (2016\u20132020) to recreate the sensations of specific places or moments. In an interview for Gagosian Quarterly she once said,  \u2018I try to depict or deliver not only a visual translation of a place in time, but with that, the scent, the sound, and the feeling. Is it chilly? Is it hot? Is there a clanging sound?\u2019Her work was included in the exhibitions Variations: Conversations in and Around Abstract Painting at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2014. That same year she received the $25,000 Artist Award from the Artists' Legacy Foundation founded by Viola Frey. Examples of Weatherford's abstract paintings incorporating neon lights are held by the Museum of Modern Art, the Hirshhorn Museum, and the Hammer Museum. Another of her neon paintings, Past Sunset (2015), was shown at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in the 2016 exhibition NO MAN'S LAND: Women Artists from the Rubell Family Collection. Three examples of her early work combining acrylic, ink and screen print are held by the Brooklyn Museum: Madame Butterfly (1989), Violetta (1991), and First Riddle (1991).\nAn exhibition of works inspired by Titian\u2019s \u201cThe Flaying of Marsyas\u201d at Museo di Palazzo Grimani opened in Venice during the 2022 Venice Biennale.\n",

            "early_life": "Weathers was born January 14, 1948, in New Orleans, Louisiana. His father was a day laborer. As an eighth-grade student, he earned an athletic scholarship to St. Augustine High School, a private school. He was an all-around athlete, involved in boxing, football, gymnastics, judo, soccer, and wrestling. He played football and graduated from Long Beach Poly high in 1966.\nWeathers played football as a defensive end in college. He started his college career in 1966 at Long Beach City College, where he did not play in 1966 due to an ankle injury suffered when he tripped over a curb surrounding the running track while warming up for practice with another linebacker. He then transferred and played for San Diego State University, becoming a letterman for the San Diego State Aztecs in 1968 and 1969, helping the Aztecs win the 1969 Pasadena Bowl, finishing with an 11\u20130 record, and a No. 18 ranking in the Final UPI Poll, playing for head coach Don Coryell. At San Diego State, Weathers received a master in theatre arts.\nAfter he went undrafted, Weathers signed with the Oakland Raiders as a free agent in 1970. Now playing as a linebacker, Weathers played in seven games for the Raiders in 1970, helping them win the  AFC West Division title, on their way to the first-ever AFC Championship Game. Weathers only played in one game in 1971, before the Raiders released him.\nHe then signed with the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League in 1971 and played until 1973, playing 18 games in total. During the off-seasons, Weathers attended San Francisco State University and earned a bachelor's degree in drama in 1974.\nHe retired from football in 1974, and began pursuing an acting career. In his NFL career he appeared in 8 games in two seasons, but didn't record any stats. The only stat he recorded in his CFL career was a single fumble recovery. In later years, Weathers narrated NFL Films' season recap of the 1999, 2000 and 2001 seasons. During the 2017 NFL Draft, he appeared on NFL Network's pre-draft coverage.\nWeathers began working as an extra while still playing football. He had his first significant roles in two blaxploitation films directed by his longtime friend Arthur Marks: Bucktown (1975) and Friday Foster (1975). Weathers also appeared in an early 1975 episode of the sitcom Good Times titled \"The Nude\", portraying an angry husband who suspected his wife of cheating on him with J.J. He also guest-starred in a 1975 episode of Kung Fu titled \"The Brothers Caine\", and in an episode of Cannon titled \"The Hero\". In 1976, he appeared as a loan shark in an episode of the crime-drama Starsky and Hutch, and in the Barnaby Jones episode \"The Bounty Hunter\" as escaped convict Jack Hopper.\nWhile auditioning for the role of Apollo Creed alongside Sylvester Stallone in Rocky, Weathers criticized Stallone's acting, which led to him getting the role. He reprised the role of Apollo Creed in the next 3 Rocky films: Rocky II (1979), Rocky III (1982), and Rocky IV (1985).\nWeathers is briefly seen as an Army MP in one of the three released versions of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (originally released in 1977). In 1978, Weathers portrayed Vince Sullivan in a TV movie, Not This Time. In the late 1970s and 1980s, Weathers starred in a number of action films for the small and big screen, including Force 10 from Navarone (1978), Predator (1987), Action Jackson (1988), and Hurricane Smith (1992). As a member of the cast of Predator, Weathers worked with future California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and future Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura. Many years later he appeared in a spoof segment on Saturday Night Live,  announcing that he was running for political office and urging viewers to vote for him on the basis that \"he was the black guy in Predator\".\nHe also appeared in Michael Jackson's \"Liberian Girl\" music video and co-starred in the 1996 Adam Sandler comedy Happy Gilmore, as Chubbs, a golf legend teaching Happy how to play golf. He reprised the role nearly four years later in the Sandler comedy Little Nicky. Filming a fall stunt in Happy Gilmore, Weathers fractured two vertebrae and his osteophytes grew out and connected and self-fused badly. He says he was in excruciating pain for three to four years.Another notable TV role was Sgt. Adam Beaudreaux on the cop show Street Justice. Afterwards, during the final two seasons of In the Heat of the Night, from 1992-1994, his character, Hampton Forbes, replaced Bill Gillespie as the chief of police. He also played as MACV-SOG Colonel Brewster in the CBS series Tour of Duty.In 2004, Weathers received a career revival as a comedic actor beginning with appearances in three episodes of the comedy series Arrested Development as a cheapskate caricature of himself, who serves as Tobias F\u00fcnke's acting coach. He was then cast in the comedies The Sasquatch Gang and The Comebacks. Weathers had a guest role in two episodes of The Shield as the former training officer of main character Vic Mackey.Weathers provided the voice for Colonel Samuel Garrett in the Pandemic Studios video game Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction. In 2005, he was a narrator on Conquest! The Price Of Victory - Witness The Journey of the Trojans!, an 18-part television show about USC athletics.

He also appeared in one episode of ER as the father of an injured boxer during their 2008 finale season.\nFor the sixth film in the Rocky series, Rocky Balboa (2006), Stallone asked Weathers, Mr. T, and Dolph Lundgren for permission to use footage from their appearances in the earlier Rocky films. Mr. T and Lundgren agreed, but Weathers wanted an actual part in the movie, even though his character had died in Rocky IV. Stallone refused, and Weathers decided not to allow Stallone to use his image for flashbacks from the previous films. They instead used footage of a fighter who looks similar to Weathers. Weathers and Stallone patched up their differences and Weathers agreed to allow footage of him from previous films to be used throughout Creed.Weathers portrayed the father of Michael Strahan and Daryl \"Chill\" Mitchell's characters on the short-lived 2009 Fox sitcom Brothers. Weathers acted as Brian \"Gebo\" Fitzgerald in advertising for Old Spice's sponsorship of NASCAR driver Tony Stewart.

            "early_life": "Weathers was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan and raised in Ada, Michigan. She spent summers at a family residence on Lake Sunapee, New Hampshire, which motivated her interest in ecology and ecosystem management. She completed a B.A. in English at Albion College, M.F.S. in Forest Science at Yale University, and Ph.D. in Ecology at Rutgers University. Her early research, published in Nature, was one of the first studies to show that fog, in addition to rain, can contribute to acid pollution to forests.\nWeathers is an ecosystem ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, where she has spent most of her research career. Her research interests are broad and she has made significant contributions to our understanding of atmospheric ecology, terrestrial ecology, and aquatic ecology. To date, Weathers has written or contributed to over 200 peer-reviewed articles, which have received over 13,000 citations. Her research is focused on understanding of how air-water-land interactions affect ecosystem functioning. For example, she has worked with colleagues to quantify how fog and precipitation can both provide critical nutrients to forest ecosystems, but also harmful pollutants. Other notable research has studied the effects of storms on lake water quality and coupled human-ecosystem interactions.She is the lead editor of the foundational textbook Fundamentals of Ecosystem Science with David Strayer and Gene Likens. In addition to co-authoring the textbook, Weathers has led multiple synthesis efforts in ecosystem science, including setting a research agenda for the discipline.Weathers has taken many leadership roles within the ecological community that have informed policy. Weathers is the current (elected) President of the Ecological Society of America (2020-2021) and was the elected Chair of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (2011-2012).

            "early_life": "Born in Pineland, Texas, Weatherspoon was a health and physical education major and star basketball player at Louisiana Tech. In 1988, her senior season, she led the Lady Techsters to the NCAA national title. After college, Weatherspoon played overseas in Italy, France and Russia for 8 years.\nWeatherspoon is one of the original players of the WNBA in 1997 when she joined the New York Liberty in the WNBA's inaugural season. A talented ball-handler and charismatic leader, her energetic play quickly endeared her to the fans and media in New York. In 1997 she was the first winner of the league's Defensive Player of the Year Award. She won the title again in 1998.\nDuring the 1999 WNBA Finals, Weatherspoon had one of the most memorable feats in WNBA history; in Game 2 on September 4, 1999 the Liberty were down 67\u201365 against the Houston Comets with no timeouts left and 2.4 seconds left on the game clock after a shot made by Tina Thompson. After receiving the inbound pass, Weatherspoon dribbled the ball up to half court and made a game-winning shot 50 feet away from the basket to force a Game 3. That moment would later be referred to as \"The Shot\". Up until the 2003 season, she held the distinction of being the only WNBA player to start every one of her games. After the 2003 season, she was not re-signed by the Liberty and signed with the Los Angeles Sparks.\nWeatherspoon's final WNBA game ever was Game 2 of the 2004 Western Conference First Round on September 26, 2004 against the Sacramento Monarchs. The Sparks won the game 71 - 57 and evened the series 1 - 1 with Weatherspoon recording 2 rebounds in 3 minutes. However, Weatherspoon did not play in Game 3 and the Sparks lost that game 58 - 73 and were eliminated from the playoffs. After her 2004 season with the Sparks, Weatherspoon retired.\nIn 2007 Weatherspoon was the head coach of the Westchester Phantoms of the American Basketball Association.  In April 2008 she joined the coaching staff of the Lady Techsters of Louisiana Tech.  On February 9, 2009, she was promoted to interim head coach to replace former head coach Chris Long. April 2, 2009 saw Louisiana Tech shed the interim label and name Teresa head women's basketball coach. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in the fifteen-year history of the WNBA. In 2016, Weatherspoon was named in the WNBA Top 20@20. On September 26, 2019, Weatherspoon was named two-way player development coach for the New Orleans Pelicans. Weatherspoon was later promoted to a full-time assistant coach for the Pelicans on November 16, 2020. The Pelicans released Weatherspoon from the coaching staff in June 2023.\nWeatherspoon was selected to represent the US at the inaugural Goodwill games, held in Moscow in July 1986. North Carolina State's Kay Yow served as head coach. The team opened up with a 72\u201353 of Yugoslavia, and followed that with a 21-point win over Brazil 91\u201370. The third game was against Czechoslovakia and would be much closer, ending in a 78\u201370 victory. The USA faced Bulgaria in the semi-final match up, and again won, this time 67\u201358. This set up the final against the Soviet Union, led by 7-foot-2 Ivilana Semenova, considered the most dominant player in the world. The Soviet team, had a 152\u20132 record in major international competition over the prior three decades, including an 84\u201382 win over the US in the 1983 World Championships. The Soviets held the early edge, leading 21\u201319 at one time, before the USA went on a scoring run to take a large lead they would never relinquish. The final score was 83\u201360 in favor of the US, earning the gold medal for the USA squad. For the entire event, Teresa Gaye Weatherspoon averaged 1.6 points per game.Weatherspoon continued with the National team at the 1986 World Championship, held in Moscow, a month after the Goodwill games in Moscow, although she was injured and unable to play. The USA team was even more dominant this time. The early games were won easily, and the semifinal against Canada, while the closest game for the USA so far, ended up an 82\u201359 victory.  At the same time, the Soviet team was winning easily as well, and the final game pitted two teams each with 6\u20130 records. The Soviet team, having lost only once at home, wanted to show that the Goodwill games setback was a fluke. The USA team started by scoring the first eight points, and raced to a 45\u201323 lead, although the Soviets fought back and reduced the halftime margin to 13. The USA went on a 15\u20131 run in the second half to put the game away, and ended up winning the gold medal with a score of 108\u201388.Weatherspoon was selected to be a member of the team representing the US at the 1987 World University Games held in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. The USA team won four of the five contests.  After winning their first two games against Poland and Finland, the USA faced the host team Yugoslavia. The game went to overtime, but Yugoslavia prevailed, 93\u201389. The USA faced China in the next game. They won 84\u201383, but they needed to win by at least five points to remain in medal contention. They won the final game against Canada to secure fifth place. Weatherspoon averaged 8.6 points per games. She recorded 21 steals over the course of the event, tied for first place on the team.\nWeatherspoon was born to Charles and Rowena Weatherspoon in Pineland, Texas. Her father, Charles Sr., played minor league baseball in the Minnesota Twins' farm system, and holds the record for the most grand slams (3) in a minor league game. Weatherspoon has two brothers and three sisters. She credits her family, especially her mother Rowena Weatherspoon, as the biggest influence on her basketball career. Her fans call her by her nicknames \"T-Spoon\" or \"Spoon\". She and former  Atlanta Falcons linebacker Sean Weatherspoon are second cousins.\nIn 1999, she published a book titled Teresa Weatherspoon's Basketball for Girls, filled with anecdotes and advice on improving basketball skills for young girls.\nWNBA no. 2 all-time in career assists\nLed the New York Liberty to the first ever WNBA Finals in 1997 and again in 1999\nStarted in the first five WNBA All-Star games (1999\u20132003 )\nAll-WNBA Second Team (1997\u20132000)\nWNBA Defensive Player of the Year (1997, 1998)\nHit a memorable court to court shot to tie the WNBA Finals series with the Houston Comets in 1999\nStarted all her WNBA games up until the 2003 season\nInducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, Class of 2019\n",

He spent five years playing in the lower leagues, including spells at Heswall, Welsh sides Caernarfon Town and Newtown, and Runcorn. His big break came, aged 22, when on 14 March 1990 he joined first division side Nottingham Forest for a fee of \u00a380,000.\nUpon leaving Forest in 2000, and after a short trial with Bolton Wanderers, Woan signed for Swindon Town and in the 2000/01 season, producing three goals from 25 appearances.\nA year later Woan found himself joining American team Columbus Crew. Married to an American wife, the then 33-year-old winger endured a difficult season in Major League Soccer with the team winning just two of their eight opening matches. This led to the replacing of manager Tom Fitzgerald, the man who had secured Woan's contract in America.\nAt the end of the season, Woan was traded to the Miami Fusion and finished his MLS career with them.In 2002, Woan returned to England and signed for struggling Shrewsbury Town, who were at the bottom of the Third Division. Woan teamed up with ex-Forest striker Nigel Jemson and the pair notably inspired the Shrews to one of their greatest ever results. The Shropshire outfit defeated Everton \u2013 who featured a young Wayne Rooney \u2013 in January 2003 in the third round of the FA Cup, with Jemson scoring twice. It was Woan's last minute cross that ensured the Premier League side's fate, but the Shrews were knocked out of the competition 4\u20130 by Chelsea the next round in a televised match. Shrewsbury were relegated that season and Woan returned to America.\nWoan then joined the Syracuse Salty Dogs of the A-League (the U.S. second tier) and competed in another season in the States before deciding to return to England.\nWoan headed back to Swindon Town, taking charge of the under 18 side at the County Ground until deciding to move to Rushden & Diamonds as first team coach for Paul Hart in July 2006. Following the sacking of Hart later on in 2006, Woan then returned to Nottingham Forest, charged with coaching some of the youngsters coming through the Forest Academy. In March 2007 he was signed for Hucknall Town by one-time teammate Andy Legg, but didn't play in any games.\nOn 7 July 2007, Premier League outfit Portsmouth announced that Woan had joined as coach of their Under-18s. In November 2009, he was appointed joint caretaker manager at Portsmouth along with Paul Groves, following the dismissal of Hart. His appointment only lasted several days, and he moved aside for the arrival of Avram Grant as the full-time manager.\nIn the summer of 2010, following the departure of Grant to West Ham United and the appointment of Steve Cotterill as the new Portsmouth manager, Woan was appointed first team coach. In June 2011, he joined Watford as assistant manager.\nIn the summer of 2012, Woan and Tony Loughlan departed Watford after Gianfranco Zola's appointment as manager.\nOn 30 October 2012, Woan linked up with former management partner Sean Dyche at Burnley. Woan was dismissed along with Dyche on 15 April 2022.On 30th January 2023, Woan was appointed assistant manager of Everton.\nHe is the son of Alan Woan who also played professionally, most notably for Northampton Town, Crystal Palace and Aldershot.\n",

            "early_life": "Wodening grew up with her brother Jack Collom in Western Springs, Illinois. She married Stan Brakhage in 1957. Before marrying Brakhage, she was studying to be a zoologist. On her reason for dropping out, Wodening said:I quit school because I was unpopular. I was not the norm, even though I really tried. I wore the right clothes, and I washed myself, I took baths and shaved my armpits, and\u2014oh! The things I did. But it didn't work, none of it worked. I was just weird. I didn't say the right things, I didn't look in the right direction. Out of it, I've always been out of it.During their marriage, she was featured in one of Brakhage's best-known works, the experimental short film Window Water Baby Moving. In the film, her husband films her giving birth. Critic Archer Winsten described the film as being \"so forthright, so full of primitive wonder and love, so far beyond civilization in its acceptance that it becomes an experience like few in the history of movies.\" The Academy Film Archive preserved Window Water Baby Moving in 2013.She later featured in another \"birth film\" filmed by Brakhage, called Thigh Line Lyre Triangular (1961), though this film was less critically acclaimed. Wodening is also featured in several other acclaimed works, many of which she played a significant role in the actual making of (directing, photographing, and editing), such as Cats Cradle (1959), Wedlock House: An Intercourse (1959), and Dog Star Man (1961-64).\n\nBrakhage and Wodening have both stated that she played a large role in Brakhage's career. In an interview once, Brakhage is quoted as having said, \"'By Brakhage' should be understood to mean 'by way of Stan and Jane Brakhage,' as it does in all my films since marriage. It is coming to mean: 'by way of Stan and Jane and all the children Brakhage.'\" Wodening has reiterated this as well saying: And so, this point of contention about, was I a partner in Stan's work. Stan said so, over and over again, from the stage. And that's interesting. . . . So, I'll see what I can say, but what I'm speaking from is: I was working on the films.While Wodening was married to Brakhage, experimental filmaker and feminist Barbara Hammer made a short documentary about her titled Jane Brakhage. Released in 1974, the film takes an intimate look at her life and features prominent voice-over of Wodening discussing her views on life, nature, philosophy, and being a housewife. Interestingly, in order to more directly focus on Wodening's life, Hammer chose not to include any footage, or mention, of Brakhage (whose work she admired) in the documentary. Initially the film was meant to act as Hammer's masters thesis film for San Francisco State University but it was rejected.\nAfter almost 30 years of marriage, Brakhage separated from Wodening in 1986, and the divorce was finalized a year later. She subsequently lived in her car for two years and drove all over America, creating the book Driveabout. Later, she lived alone in a tiny cabin at 10,000 feet elevation in the Rocky Mountains, creating another book Living Up There while getting out several collections of short stories.In 2004, she moved to Denver, Colorado and continued writing books, such as Wolf Dictionary, The Lady Orangutan and Other Stories,  Animals I've Neglected to Mention, and Brakhage\u2019s Childhood.\n",

Potter Award. Wodicka was then named a Guggenheim Fellow which allowed him to undertake early clinical studies of novel monitoring systems for neonates at the Massachusetts General Hospital. These studies ultimately led to his founding of SonarMed, Inc. with two of his doctoral students, Jeffrey Mansfield and Eduardo Juan, which developed and marketed the only FDA-approved system to monitor the position of breathing tubes in infants requiring assisted ventilation.  SonarMed, Inc. was then acquired by Medtronic, Inc. which markets the system worldwide.\nWodicka was named the founding head of the new Department of Biomedical Engineering at Purdue University in 1998. He guided significant philanthropic gifts that were recognized by renaming the department the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, establishing the Dane A. Miller Headship, as well as creating both the Leslie A. Geddes and Marta E. Gross professorships and the Bottorff Fellows graduate program. He also led an initiative that resulted in support from the State of Indiana.

He graduated in 1968 with an M.F.A. degree in industrial design and worked for the next two years at UNITRA, Warsaw, designing popular electronic products. From 1970 until his emigration to Canada in 1977, he designed professional optical, mechanical, and electronic instruments at the Polish Optical Works.In 1969, Wodiczko collaborated with Andrzej Dluzniewski and Wojciech Wybieralski on a design proposal for a memorial to victims of Majdanek concentration camp in Poland. He also performed with Personal Instrument in the streets of Warsaw and participated in the Biennale de Paris as a leader of a group architectural project. He was a teaching assistant for two years, 1969\u201370, in the Basic Design Program at the Academy of Fine Arts before moving to the Warsaw Polytechnic Institute, where he taught until 1976. Throughout the 1970s he continued his collaborations on sound and music performances with various musicians and artists.\nIn 1971, Wodiczko began work on Vehicle, which he tested the following year on the streets of Warsaw. In 1972 he created his first solo installation: Corridor at Galeria Wspolczesna, Warsaw. The following year he began exhibiting with Galeria Foksal, Warsaw. In 1975, Wodiczko traveled for the first time to the United States where he was artist-in-residence at the University of Illinois, Urbana and exhibited at N.A.M.E. Gallery, Chicago. He participated again in the Biennale de Paris, this time as a solo artist.\nIn 1976, Wodiczko began a two-year artist-in-residence program at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. He emigrated from Poland in 1977, establishing residency in Canada teaching at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and began working with New York art dealer Hal Bromm.

Moving from graffiti art to the studio in 2000 Woehr started to experiment with painting on canvas and constructing sculptural dioramas. Working in these modes of expression Woehr sought to capture the dynamism of the urban experience and environment. Recognized for his artistic talent in 2010 Woehr was chosen, along with four other artists, to represent Germany in the Fine Art international art exhibition, an arts initiative and traveling exhibition created to celebrate the FIFA World Cup of the same year.\nIn 2013 Woehr sought new means to treat the city, his urban subject matter. His abstract images depict a bird's eye view, a vision which represents the fundamental essence of an urban experience Woehr eschews realistic depictions, alternatively restructuring and reshaping the streets and architecture of a particular city he has visited in a style reminiscent of the Russian Constructivists, like Kazimir Malevich, El Lissitzky, Vladimir Tatlin and the artists of the Bauhaus such as L\u00e1szlo Moholy-Nagy, from whom he draws inspiration. By titling each work with a location's geographic or GPS coordinates, Woehr invites viewer participation, research and exploration of the subject city. While each work is a translation of the artist's personal connection with a particular city, the receding dimensionality of each multi-layer image leaves the viewer a conceptual space for her own interpretation. Although he works primarily in the studio, Woehr remains close to the urban landscape continuing to paint outside on city walls, buildings, trains and large-scale sculptures. These works achieve the same objectives as his sculptural reliefs, as he crafts the illusion of the three-dimensional space in these painted constructions. Painted on a monumental scale this work envelops the viewer, inviting her into a newly conceived urban environment and experience.\n",

            "early_life": "Woeser, a quarter Han Chinese and three quarters Tibetan, was born in Lhasa. Her grandfather, Chinese, was an officer in the Nationalist Army of the Kuomintang and her father was a high rank Army officer in the People's Liberation Army. \nWhen she was very young, her family relocated to the Kham area of western Sichuan province. In 1988, she graduated from Southwest University for Nationalities in Chengdu with a degree in Chinese literature. She worked as a reporter in Kardz\u00e9 and later in Lhasa and has lived in Beijing since 2003 as a result of political problems. Woeser is married to Wang Lixiong, a renowned author who frequently writes about Tibet. According to Reporters sans fronti\u00e8res, \"Woeser is one of the few Tibetan authors and poets to write in Chinese.\" When the government refused to give her a passport, she sued the authorities.\nWoeser is the author of the book, Notes on Tibet (\u897f\u85cf\u7b14\u8bb0; X\u012bz\u00e0ng B\u01d0j\u00ec). The Tibet Information Network quotes unnamed sources that the book was banned by the government around September 2003.According to UNPO, shortly after the alleged ban, Woeser was also fired from her job and lost her status with her work unit. Radio Free Asia reported that she continued to post a variety of poems and articles to her two blogs: Maroon Map (\u7edb\u7ea2\u8272\u7684\u5730\u56fe, oser.tibetcul.net), which, according to the author, was visited primarily by Tibetans and the Woeser blog (blog.daqi.com/weise), which was visited primarily by those of Han ethnicity. According to RFA, on July 28, 2006, both blogs were closed by order of the government, apparently in response to postings in which she expressed birthday greetings to the Dalai Lama and touched on other sensitive topics. Woeser stated that she would continue writing and speaking.\n\nDuring the Tibetan unrest of 2008, Woeser and her husband were put under house arrest after speaking to reporters. In December 2008, Woeser and her husband were among the first of the original 303 signatories to Charter 08, now joined by thousands more. Liu Xiaobo, the author of Charter 08, was sentenced for eleven years of prison and awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. In July 2009, Woeser and her husband were one of more than 100 signatories to a petition asking Chinese authorities to release detained ethnic-Uyghur professor of economics Ilham Tohti. When she was honoured with the Prince Claus Awards in 2011, she was forbidden to receive the prize in the Dutch embassy.Tsering Woeser defended Tibetan actions in the 1905 Tibetan Rebellion, saying that Zhao Erfeng invaded the region to  \"brutally stop Tibetan protests\", listing atrocities committed by Zhao.Woeser's writings are regularly translated into English by the translations website High Peaks Pure Earth.\n",

As an assistant professor of medicine, he published a study finding that patients with AIDS may be at significantly greater risk of death when cytomegalovirus (CMV) reaches their blood. The study then raised an issue about whether people infected with HIV should receive preemptive treatment with drugs against CMV.As a professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases, Wohl and colleague William A. Fischer II collaborated with healthcare workers in Liberia to combat Ebola. They later wrote about their experiences in a piece published in The New England Journal of Medicine, arguing that \"patients with Ebola virus disease in countries with limited resources should be treated according to the same standard of care that is used in countries where resources are more readily available.\" In 2017, Wohl and Fischer found that survivors of Ebola still carried the infection in their semen even two years later.During the COVID-19 pandemic in North America, Wohl was one of North Carolina's leaders against the disease. He was appointed the Medical Director of the COVID Vaccination Clinic at UNC Hospitals Hillsborough Campus and led COVID-19 treatment clinical trials at UNC. Wohl also collaborated with Natalie Bowman to track COVID-19 patients in the hospital and local community, and worked with the AIDS Clinical Trials Group to test therapeutics (hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin) for early traces of COVID-19.

As he grew more familiar with the woodlands he was overseeing, he became disenchanted due to the damage caused by the techniques and technologies he was expected to employ, including the felling of mature trees and the use of insecticides.Professionally, Wohlleben manages a beech forest on behalf of the municipality of H\u00fcmmel, Germany. He offers regular forest tours at his forest academy.Wohlleben advocates for animal welfare and has raised awareness about the treatment of animals. He has controversially argued that plants feel pain and has stated that \"It's okay to eat plants. It's okay to eat meat, although I'm a vegetarian, because meat is the main forest killer. But if plants are conscious about what they are doing, it's okay to eat them. Because otherwise we will die. And it's our right to survive.\u201d\nWohlleben began publishing books popularizing scientific research about ecology and forest management in 2007. The appearance of his Das geheime Leben der B\u00e4ume through Random House's Ludwig imprint led to profiles and reviews in all the major German newspapers, including skeptical pieces in the business press. The book was featured in a cover story in Der Spiegel and appeared on the Spiegel bestseller list.His 2012 book Kranichflug und Blumenuhr, was translated as The Weather Detective: Rediscovering Nature's Secret Signs in 2018. The Secret Wisdom of Nature: Trees, Animals, and the Extraordinary Balance of All Living Things \u2013 Stories from Science and Observation was released in 2019. Wohlleben's first book for children available in English was published in October 2019.

An English translation was published in September 2016 under the title The Hidden Life of Trees: What they Feel, How they Communicate with a foreword by Australian environmentalist Tim Flannery, published by Greystone Books in partnership with the David Suzuki Institute. It cites the research of Suzanne Simard. The book was widely criticized by biologists and forest scientists for using strong anthropomorphic and teleological language such as describing trees as having friendships and registering fear, love and pain. It has been described as containing a \"conglomeration of half-truths, biased judgements, and wishful thinking\".A documentary film Intelligent Trees features several of Wohlleben's observations. He appears alongside Suzanne Simard, a professor of forest ecology at the University of British Columbia, who has been doing research on interactions among trees through micorrhizal networks since 1997.A second documentary film was released under the title The Hidden Life of Trees in theaters in the United States. It had its UK premiere at the 2021 Wales One World Film Festival, which was presented online owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2016, Wohlleben authored Das Seelenleben der Tiere, which was translated into English and published under the title The Inner Life of Animals: Love, Grief, and Compassion\u2014Surprising Observations of a Hidden World in 2017.

            "early_life": "Woisnitza was born in R\u00fcdersdorf. Before she went to art school, she took part in a drawing group in her hometown led by the artist Erika St\u00fcrmer-Alex. She studied set design from 1973 to 1979 at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. In her core curriculum, she studied with Gnter Hornig, who was an inspiration to a number of influential performance artists in East Germany and who gave his students room for creative experimentation despite the conservative climate of the academy. During her studies, Woisnitza brought together women artists and founded loose networks. These included her fellow students and upcoming artists like Christine Schlegel, Marie-Luise Bauerschmidt, Sabine Gumnitz, Monika Hanske, Cornelia Schleime, and Angela Schumann. They realized a number of collective events together. These informal performances involved body actions, such as Face Painting Action (Gesichts-malaktion, 1978\u20131979).In 1991, Woisnitza received a diploma in painting and graphic design from the Academy. In 1992, she received the Marianne Werefkin Prize from the Berlin Women Artist Association. From 1993 to 1995, she painted seven large frescoes for the Virchow-Klinikum campus of the Charit\u00e9 hospital in Berlin. In 1994, Woisnitza received the K\u00e4the Kollwitz Prize from the Berlin Academy of Arts. In 2002, she created a fresco for the church hall of the Evangelical church in R\u00fcdersdorf.Woisnitza was encouraged by two artist/teachers, Gunther Hornig and Erika Sturmer-Alex to do non-conformist conceptual art.  She developed \"an artistic activation of the body in the interest of female self-assurance and empowerment\" and would call \"into question traditional representations of femininity as well as the basic difference between internal and external perception.\"Woisnitza's work is in the National Museum of Women in the Arts.\n\n\n== References ==\n",

            "early_life": "Wu credits most of their inspiration to their mother Jean Carole Wu. Their maternal grandmother Joan Davis was the head designer of Tai Ping Carpets Hong Kong in the 1960s. Wu attended Hillfield Strathallan College and, in late 2009, they attended the University of Toronto aiming to go into a career of sex therapy. They dropped out after one year.After creating their portfolio, they were accepted by the Istituto Marangoni, but deferred the offer to start their own company in September 2010. In 2011, they opened their first boutique in downtown Toronto.\nWu learned to sew in 2009 after they dropped out of the University of Toronto. Their first break was being offered a position at MuchMusic in April 2010 as a Fashion Correspondent, where they worked for half a year. The same day that Wu was offered the position, they received an invitation to show their Fall Winter 2010 Collection at Vancouver Fashion Week. Wu was nineteen years old. They showed their very first time at Vancouver Fashion Week, which kick started their career as a fashion designer. Wu participated in the Spring-Summer 2011 Collection at the National Gallery of Canada during the Ottawa Fashion Week in October 2010. In the same month, they met Shawn Hewson of Project Runway Canada through the Alumni Association of Hillfield Strathallan College. Hewson mentored Wu for a year and introduced them to the Fashion Design Council of Canada. In 2009 artist Mehrnaz had illustrated a painting of one of Wu's earlier pieces.In November 2010, Wu was offered their first corporate collaboration, with The Allan Candy Co., based in Hamilton, Ontario. Wu was commissioned to create dresses out of Allan Candy wrappers for an online advertisement. This was the first time Allan Candy had collaborated with a fashion designer and used the advertisement to launch its DOPS candy line.Quickly known as the 18-year-old-boy who modelled their own dresses, Prestel published Wu internationally in a book called Style Diaries: World Fashion from Berlin to Tokyo in February 2011. The author, Simone Werle, featured Wu as \"one of the most influential forces behind tomorrow's trends\".In March 2011, R&B singer Keisha Chant\u00e9 modelled Wu's dress in the Dare to Wear Love Fashion Show. After the show, Wu's work was featured at Textile Museum of Canada as a part of Canada's first Fashion Exhibition, called Dare to Wear Love, in support of the Stephen Lewis Foundation.At twenty-one, Wu debuted their Spring-Summer 2012 Collection, titled \"Creatures of the Photons\", at Toronto Fashion Week; the collection featured dresses resembling \"large testicles and penis shapes jutting\". Wu has been critiqued as having \"remarkable silhouettes\", as quoted by the Ottawa Citizen. Huffington Post said Wu had \"dramatic and breathtaking designs.\" Wu was also called \"a fashion wunderkind\" by both the Ottawa Citizen and Toronto Star.Wu had the opportunity to collaborate with Margaret Atwood at the Book Lovers Ball, hosted in support of the Toronto Public Library in January 2012. Wu created designs inspired by Atwood's 2011 book In Other Worlds: SF and the Human Imagination. Margaret tweeted that Wu is \"a brilliant designer\". In March 2012, Wu was also involved with the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada in their annual event, The Heart Truth. Jessi Cruikshank, eTalk's host, modeled a Wu creation as event's opening dress. Later that month, Canada's Got Talent host Dina Pugliese modeled Wu's custom designed dress for the 2012 Dare to Wear Love Fashion Show, again serving as a fundraiser for the Steven Lewis Foundation.Wu has dressed celebrities such as Jessi Cruickshank, Keshia Chant\u00e9, Dina Pugliese, Kreesha Turner, and Christine Avanti.Other publications which have covered Wu include The Globe and Mail, Flare, Fashion and the National Post. Other television news and fashion programs to cover WU include FashionTelevision, CBC's Creative Block and CNTV's Culture Express.Wu designed a tutu for the National Ballet of Canada's 60th anniversary celebration which is to be debuted late 2012. Wu has also recently been commissioned to their second corporate collaboration recently. Wu was to create a dress out of Canadian company Kruger Inc.'s Cashmere toilet paper. Kruger planned to launch this \"White Cashmere Collection\" in September 2012. Wu became a spokesperson for Perrier as an official social influencer in 2012.\nIn 2015, Wu came out as neutrois, a non-binary gender identity, and started going by they/them pronouns. In the following year, Wu wrote an article on Medium explaining the concept of being non-binary and how it differs greatly from other transgender identities. They have since openly participated in the Trans Fusion drop-ins at the Sherbourne Health Centre in Toronto, advocating for the visibility of non-binary identities within the vast spectrum of gender diversity. During 2016, Wu posted video updates about their transition journey on their personal YouTube channel. By no later than December 2017, Wu changed their first name to Adrienne.In 2015, Wu began advocating with Toronto's Supporting Our Youth organization.\n",

She earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry (magna cum laude) from Harvard and her Medical degree from Stanford University School of Medicine. Upon completing her medical degree, Wu was trained in internal medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and completed her medical fellowship in oncology and hematology at the Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute.\nIn 2000, Wu joined the Dana-Farber faculty and began her independent research program in 2005.In 2011, Wu was the recipient of a Stand Up To Cancer Innovative Research Grant for her project \"Coupled Genetic and Functional Dissection of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.\" Using this grant, she identified mutations in the splicing factor SF3B1 connected to the development of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). The following year, Wu continued to lead studies on clonal heterogeneity and clonal evolution of CLL and was subsequently elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation. Wu later led a study analyzing genetic material in CLL and normal tissue of over 500 patients. Her research team identified numerous genetic abnormalities that had the ability to drive leukemia, including RPS15 and IKZF3 which had never before been linked to human cancer.In 2019, Wu continued her research on patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and led a research study which collaborated with scientists at the Broad Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the University of Washington. They found that genetic changes that occur very early in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia development directly influenced the growth pattern the CLL cells would ultimately take. As a result of her research, she was elected a Member of the National Academy of Medicine. Wu later led a study which uncovered why some patients become resistant to Venclexta, a Leukemia drug. Her research team used leukemia samples from before treatment with venetoclax and following their resistance. They then analyzed the tissue looking for genomic differences in the before and after relapse samples. The results of the analysis were lacking so they performed a large-scale loss-of-function screen to see the effect on other genes. Through this screening, they found that resistant cells make too much MCL1. Using a similar approach, Wu also studies how to implement personalized cancer vaccines by identifying neoantigen targets created by a patient's tumor. This immunotherapeutic effort is applicable to blood and solid tumor malignancies.\n\n\n== References ==\n",

His parents, Diana (n\u00e9e Liu), a college professor, and George Wu, a retired engineer, are natives of Shanghai, China. His father immigrated to the United States from China and met his mother in New York, where she was a student. After marrying, they settled in California. Wu has two older sisters, Greta and Gloria, and an older brother who died when he was two.Wu developed an interest in martial arts when he saw Jet Li in The Shaolin Temple and Donnie Yen in Iron Monkey, and consequently began studying wushu at age 11. His childhood role model was Jackie Chan, a man who now considers Wu \"like a son\". Wu attended the Head-Royce School in Oakland, California and later majored in architecture at the University of Oregon. While there, he founded the University of Oregon Wushu Club in 1994 and served as the team's first coach. During this time, Wu took film classes and frequented local theaters, and came to enjoy the works of filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa and Luc Besson, whom he describes as \"men of vision.\"Following graduation, Wu traveled in 1997 to Hong Kong to witness the handover of Hong Kong, with no intention of taking on a film career. At the suggestion by his sister, Wu began modeling. Four months later, film director Yonfan, after seeing Wu featured in a clothing ad, approached Wu about starring in an upcoming film.\nDespite his inability at the time to speak Cantonese or read Chinese, Wu successfully completed his first film, Yonfan's Bishonen in 1998. As of this day, when Wu receives a Cantonese script, his assistant reads the entire piece, while he makes notes on the pronunciation. The day after Bishonen wrapped, Wu was offered the leading role in Mabel Cheung's City of Glass (for which Wu was nominated as best new actor at the 18th Hong Kong Film Awards) and later, a supporting part in Young and Dangerous: The Prequel, from Andrew Lau's gangster film series. Around this time, Wu met Jackie Chan at a restaurant opening and was quickly signed to Chan's JC Group with agent Willie Chan.Wu's breakthrough performance came in 1999 with his role in Benny Chan's Gen-X Cops. He followed this success with roles in a variety of films including big-budget thriller Purple Storm, arthouse production Peony Pavilion and the successful Love Undercover. In 2001, Wu received criticism from the Hong Kong media for sexual scenes with Suki Kwan in Cop on a Mission, but Wu says that same criticism attracted the attention of directors and the film represented a turning point in the types of roles he chose in the future.Wu's first experience in film production came with his starring role in Julian Lee's 2003 film Night Corridor. Due to budgetary constraints, Wu participated in the search for funding for and distribution of, the film and recruited Jun Kung to create the soundtrack. Though Night Corridor dealt with \"risky\" themes, Wu felt he had less reliance on image than many of his pop-star actor peers, and he was nominated for best actor at Taiwan's 40th Golden Horse Film Awards for his effort. During 2003, Wu took part as producer and creative director on MTV's Whatever Things!, a Jackass-styled program aired in Asia, also featuring Sam Lee, Josie Ho, Terence Yin, and other celebrities. During 2003, Wu took part in a stage production of The Happy Prince at the Edward Lam Dance Theater as part of the Hong Kong Arts Festival, during which he recited a 16-minute monologue in Cantonese, learned entirely from pinyin. In 2005, Wu was nominated as best actor at the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards for his role in Derek Yee's One Nite in Mongkok, and as best supporting actor for New Police Story. At the 41st Golden Horse Film Awards, Wu won the award for best supporting actor for New Police Story. The win came as a surprise to him, because he \"didn't think that much\" of his performance in the film.\n\nIn 2005, Chinese media began to report that Wu had formed a boy band, Alive, with Terence Yin, Andrew Lin and Conroy Chan. Wu and his bandmates posted information, updates, personal thoughts (including slamming Hong Kong Disneyland, for which they were spokespersons), and the band's music, at their official website. In 2006, Wu made his writing and directorial debut with The Heavenly Kings, which chronicles Alive's formation and exploits. After the film's release, however, it was revealed that The Heavenly Kings was actually a mockumentary of the Hong Kong pop music industry, and Alive was constructed purely as a vehicle to make the film; the film's characters represented only 10\u201315% of their real-life counterparts and much of the footage blurred the line between fiction and reality. Wu admitted his own singing voice \"sucked really bad\", and the band had their voices digitally enhanced for its music, to prove that \"it's easy to fake it\". Despite some backlash from the media over being intentionally fed false information in the film about illegal downloads of the band's music, Wu won the best new director award at the 26th Hong Kong Film Awards, an achievement he called \"a group effort.\"In 2011, Wu starred alongside Kevin Spacey in director Dayyan Eng's bilingual film Inseparable. It premiered at the Busan International Film Festival and was released in cinemas in China and other territories worldwide, making it Wu's first English-language film performance.\nFrom 2015 to 2019, he starred as Sunny on the AMC action series Into the Badlands, for which he also served as executive producer.\nIn 2016, he portrayed via motion capture and voiced Gul'dan, the central antagonist of the action fantasy film Warcraft, based upon the Warcraft video game series  by Blizzard Entertainment. In 2018, he appeared in Tomb Raider, based upon the video game series of the same name, as Lara Croft's sidekick, Captain Lu Ren. In 2021, he appeared in Reminiscence, director Lisa Joy's feature film debut.\nWu maintains residences in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, and Oakland, California. He continues to actively train in wushu as well as other martial arts.On April 6, 2010, Wu married Lisa S. in South Africa. Their daughter, Raven, was born in May 2013.In 2018, Daniel Wu denied rumors of supporting Hong Kong independence and has explicitly stated his opposition for it.Both Wu and Lisa are godparents to Ase Wang's daughter.\n",

His parents, Lin Huei-ying (\u6797\u60e0\u82f1) and Wu Nai-teh met in university. Wu's father was a researcher at Academia Sinica, the preeminent academic institution in Taiwan, where he focused on political identity and transitional justice. His mother had a career in advertising and now dedicates her time to an educational nonprofit.\nReturning to Taiwan at age 6 after his father completed his PhD, Wu attended elementary and middle school in Taipei. In 1995, he moved to the United States for high school. Wu studied at high schools in Illinois and Michigan before enrolling in Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire.Wu obtained his bachelor's degree in economics from Yale College in 2003. While in college, he co-founded the Yale chapter of America Counts, a U.S. Department of Education initiative.\nWu was heavily influenced by his family and family friends' involvement in Taiwan's democratic movement. While in graduate school, his father Wu Nai-teh was an editor for dissident magazines, including Formosa Magazine and The Movement Magazine, advocating for democratic reforms while Taiwan was under martial law. After obtaining his PhD and returning to Taiwan, Wu Nai-teh was refused employment for two years at Academia Sinica, the premier research academy, on the grounds of harboring \"Taiwanese independence and subversive tendencies\" despite unanimous faculty approval.Civic engagement was a significant part of his upbringing. At just nine years old, Wu began joining his family in protests and citizen movements. In middle school, Wu collected signatures for a nuclear power plant referendum.\nAfter graduating from Yale College in 2003, Wu worked at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, primarily for the Special Situations Group, focusing on investment opportunities in Asia. In 2013, Wu left Goldman Sachs to pursue public service in Taiwan.He served with the Taiwanese Army's Special Forces Command from 2014 to 2015.

            "early_life": "Wu obtained a bachelor's degree in law from National Taiwan University, and continued his legal studies at Harvard Law School while earning a master's in business administration from Harvard University. Wu became a lawyer in New York before returning to Taiwan, where he taught at Soochow University and led the Taiwan Securities Company, a subsidiary of Taishin Financial Holdings, as chairman. Wu retained his business leadership positions while serving on the Legislative Yuan. Wu's elder brothers Thomas and Eugene are also businessmen. Eric Wu's sister Wu Ju-yueh is the eldest of his siblings. For a time, Eric Wu rented the residence of entrepreneur Chiang A-hsin, and established the Chin Kuang Fu Foundation in 1995 to maintain the property.\nWu was elected to the second Legislative Yuan from Hsinchu County as a member of the Kuomintang, serving from 1993 to 1996. He subsequently sat on the third convocation of the National Assembly, between 1996 and 2000. Wu was expelled from the Kuomintang in October 2001, after accepting a legislative nomination from the Taiwan Solidarity Union earlier that year. He won election as a party list member of the Legislative Yuan in December 2001. A month into his second term as legislator, the TSU nominated Wu to join the ROC-US Parliamentary Amity Association. He participated in overseas trips to Russia and Japan to further Taiwan's bilateral foreign relations. As a legislator with extensive business experience, Wu frequently commented on trade, economics, and industry. In June 2002, Wu explained that he and the TSU were not opposed to the three links between Taiwan and China. Rather, the party simply sought the continued implementation of Chen Shui-bian's \"no haste, be patient\" policy. In July 2003, he warned against Chinese investment in Taiwan, stating that Cross-Strait capital should be monitored to prevent politically motivated economic manipulation. As the 2003 SARS outbreak hit Taiwan, Wu and fellow TSU members Liao Pen-yen, Lo Chih-ming, Huang Chung-yuan, and Huang Cheng-che formed a working group to confront the issue. Fredrick Chien consulted Wu, among several others, when asked to form a committee to probe the 3-19 shooting incident, which injured Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu. In October 2004, Wu withdrew from consideration as a TSU candidate for the legislative elections planned in December, and consequently was not nominated for another term. Weeks before his second Legislative Yuan term ended, Wu considered attending the second inauguration of US President George W. Bush.\nIn August 2004, Thomas Wu was elected by the board of directors of Shinkong Synthetic Fibers Corporation to serve as company chairman. Their mother made it known that she preferred Eric take the position, and asked Thomas to step down. Eric and his mother contested Thomas's election, because members of the board were to be reselected prior to the vote that installed Thomas as chairman. As the chairmanship dispute unfolded, Eric and Thomas Wu were investigated by the Financial Supervisory Commission on suspicions of insider trading. In November 2004, the conflict was resolved. Thomas yielded the chairmanship of Shinkong Synthetic Fibers Corporation to Eric, and was named  to the same position at Taishin Financial Holdings. In turn, Eric ceded his proxy votes on the Taishin Financial board to Thomas. The FSC ruled in December 2004 that there were no financial gains, and therefore no insider trading, but that Taiwan Securities Company had not sought final approval to trade shares in Shinkong Synthetic Fibers. As a result, Taiwan Securities Company was fined NT$2.5 million. Additionally, Taishin Financial divested from Taishin Investment Trust, the latter of which was chaired by Eric.Eric Wu attempted to diversify his holdings in later years, exploring the potential acquisition of Taiwan Television Enterprise in December 2005, and bidding on Idee Department Store in November 2007. In September 2009, the Control Yuan voted to impeach prosecutor Lin Sheng-lin on charges of corruption. Lin had worked with Wu to establish a legal aid foundation, but was found to have extorted money, and divulged information pertinent to ongoing investigations.Under Wu's leadership, Shinkong Synthetic Fibers pursued a 4G telecommunications license in 2013. This was followed in 2014 by an increased investment in a joint venture with Invista, as well as another investment valued at NT$3 billion, in TacBright Optronics Corp, a subsidiary of Shinkong Synthetic Fibers. In 2017, Wu planned to increase the production of engineering plastics made by Shinkong Synthetic Fibers.\n\n\n== References ==\n",

            "early_life": "Wu was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on August 20, 1967. Wu's parents were immigrants from Taiwan to the United States. Wu's father was an engineer at Ford Motor Company and his father lived in Detroit, Michigan.In his book Yellow and other writings, Wu recounts how his childhood experience of being the only Asian American among his classmates and the schoolyard taunting he endured as a result of his race alerted him to racial inequalities at an early age. He further describes how his attempts to assimilate and reject what was \"Asian\" only seemed to reinforce his marked difference to his peers.\nWhen Wu was a teenager, a Chinese American man, Vincent Chin, was killed by two white autoworkers in Highland Park, Michigan. The multiple criminal and civil cases that ensued throughout the 1980s have been recognized as birthing the Asian American victims and Asian American movement, and were marked as the 34th Michigan Legal Milestone in 2009. It was the Vincent Chin case that inspired Wu to pursue an active role in civil rights advocacy and the law.\nWu earned his bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1988 and his J.D. degree from the University of Michigan Law School in 1991. He completed courses at Harvard University Graduate School of Education.\nWu was formerly a law professor at Howard University, resuming a role he held from 1995 to 2004, and visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University, where he taught Asian Americans and the Law. He also was a CV Starr Foundation Visiting Professor at the School of Transnational Law at Peking University, in its English language JD program, in summer of 2009. He has previously taught at Stanford, Michigan, Columbia, Maryland, George Washington University, and Deep Springs College.\nFrom 2004 to 2008, Wu served as the ninth dean of Wayne State University Law School in Detroit, Michigan, succeeding the law school's first female dean, Joan Mahoney (1998\u20132003). Along with Harold Hongju Koh of Yale Law School and Jim Chen of the University of Louisville School of Law, Wu was one of only three Asian American law school deans in the United States. In April 2007, Wu announced he would resign as dean in May 2008, a year before his appointment was to end, citing his wife's health problems as the leading cause of his resignation. In 2008, he was one of two recipients of the Asian Pacific Fund Chang-Lin Tien Award, given for leadership in higher education. Named for the first Asian American to head a major research university, the award comes with a $10,000 honorarium. He also has received the Trailblazer Award from the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association.\nOn July 1, 2010, at age 42, Wu became the chancellor and dean of the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, until December 2015.\nWu succeeded Nell Newton, who departed in Summer 2009, and acting Chancellor and Dean Leo Martinez. UC Hastings is a unique institution, a standalone law school affiliated with a public system and entitled to brand itself as University of California. Wu was the first Asian American to serve as the chancellor and dean University of California, Hastings College of the Law. In 2012, Wu gained national publicity for rebooting legal education, by announcing that his school would be voluntarily reducing its enrollment by 20 percent over the next three years. UC Hastings was acknowledged as the first leading law school to make such changes.\nOn March 30, 2020, the Board of Trustees of the City University of New York elected Wu as president of Queens College, City University of New York. He assumed the office on July 1, 2020.Prior to his academic career, Wu held a clerkship with the late U.S. District Judge Frank J. Battisti in Cleveland, Ohio. He then joined the law firm of Morrison & Foerster in San Francisco, concentrating on complex litigation and devoting a quarter of his time to the representation of indigent individuals.\nWu's wife is Carol L.

In 1949, at the age of 17, the artist migrated solo to Taiwan on the ship \u2018New Health\u2019 in order to flee the Civil War that was taking place in China.  On this voyage were many intellectuals, artisans, students and wealthy citizens who were also escaping from the Civil War, which saw the Communist Party take control of the Middle Kingdom and its national forces.  Between the late 1940s to the 1950s many conservative Chinese artists and radical modern painters moved to Taiwan. By doing so, they sought to promote freedom and protest against the communist regime, which was taking place in their home country.\nOn arrival in Taipei Wu Hao joined the Chinese Air Force as a junior officer. Wu was eventually promoted to a career officer and retired in 1971.  In 1967 the Department of National Defence awarded Wu with a medal of exemplary conduct.  Wu Hao practiced art throughout the entirety of his military career.\nIn 1950, as a young man in Taiwan, Wu attended an art school that was run by a group of renowned Chinese and Taiwanese artists such as Lee Chun-Sheng.  At this time, Wu could not afford to attend the classes. However, Wu convinced the administrator to give him a job as a part-time assistant, which enabled him to take part in many of the art classes taught by Lee.Lee Chun-Sheng, a well-known avant-garde artist and teacher, used his classrooms to promote and emphasise the importance of a variety of art movements in Taiwan.  Art movements regarding freedom, liberation and national identity were particularly important to the teacher. Colleagues and students of Lee's often described him as the \u201cpropagandist in the coffee room.\u201d   Having studied European painting in Japan prior to World War II, alongside traditional Chinese painting, Lee became an influential figure in the Taiwan art scene. Together with many others, Lee rebelled against traditionalists who criticised the modernist movement and aimed to reunite traditional Chinese and Taiwanese painting with Western art trends and modern abstractions.  Lee was an influential person throughout Wu's artistic career. This is particularly evident when viewing Wu's earlier and later westernised abstract oil paintings, inspired by the Western Surrealist art movement.  Whilst Wu Hao studied under the guidance of Lee Chun-Sheng, he began to enter his works into many art exhibitions, such as the Ministry of National Defence Annual Art Exhibition, and frequently won awards.During the 1950s, art materials were scarce and difficult to obtain in Taiwan. Wu, who at the time was living in poverty, resorted to using flower sacks as canvases to produce abstract oil paintings.  In the course of 1956, in conjunction with numerous other Chinese and Taiwanese artists, such as Chen Tao-Ming and Hsiao Ming-Hsien, Wu established the Tong Fan, a Taiwanese abstract painting group and art movement that explored Western styles of art, who have been credited for producing the first abstract paintings in the history of Chinese and Taiwanese art.  In 1957, a Tong Fan exhibition was held in Spain, drawing global attention to the movement.\nThroughout the 1960s, international communities had great influence on the art scene in Taiwan. Western art schools were institutionalised and taught a variety of styles including Abstractionalism, New-Objectitivism, Neoclassicism, Cubism, Surrealism, Expressionism, Structuralism, Fauvism, Symbolism, Pop Art, Minimalism, Optical Art, and so on.  This brought about a revival of the Taiwanese Nativist art movement, in which Wu was extremely influential. In 1964, Wu joined the Modern Print Society and began to produce woodblock prints. The artist temporarily abandoned oil painting, as he believed that woodblock printing was a more successful method for capturing the Orient's qualities, characteristics and identity.  The movement is thought to have emerged in 1949, and was typified by a deliberate rejection of Western art techniques that were initially introduced to Taiwan by the Japanese throughout their colonial rule. Furthermore, the movement aimed to portray indigenous Taiwanese cultural forms and their relationship to the Taiwanese social, economic, cultural and political identity.   Wu employed Nativism in his artwork to exert and explore national Taiwanese characteristics, particularly throughout the 1960s and 1970s when the movement was fruitfully revitalised. An example of this can be seen in Wu's 1967 woodblock print entitled Playing Music (annex 1).Wu's prints, for which he is best known, are often characterised by their bright and vibrant colouring and traditional Taiwanese folk like style. Often, Wu would print images depicting scenes of daily activities in the Taiwan countryside, a common theme for many Taiwanese artists of the time.  Wu's change to woodblock printing came at a time when Taiwan was becoming increasingly modernised and industrialised. Furthermore, a middle class was emerging with enough money to afford art, which changed the art scene in Taiwan.The artist returned to oil painting in 1978. During this time, Wu worked on developing both his technique and form. Wu revolutionised his work by creating oil paintings which appeared similar to that of a woodblock print.  Wu produced an extensive body of work thematically based on blooming flowers in his new style, often depicted alongside fruit. The artist used the symbol of a blooming flower (and occasionally ripe fruit) as a representation of contemporary Taiwan. Wu describes his blooming flowers as being cultivated and from soils of sorrows, reflecting Taiwan's difficult political and social past.  The prospering flowers in this body of work symbolises how strong Taiwan's identity, culture and heritage is in the contemporary era today. Flowers, (annex 2) painted in 1990, is an example of such a work.In 1987 Wu became chairman of the Chinese Modern Graphic Society and founded the Lee Chung-Sheng Modern Painting Education Foundation to commemorate the work of his influential past teacher.\n",

She was the daughter of a soldier and spent much of her childhood traveling while her father was serving in the United States Army. Her family later settled in the United States where her father began work at Capitol Hill. Wu spent much of her childhood living in Washington, D.C., and considers it to be where she was raised, despite the many places she had lived beforehand. Many years later, she moved to California.\nAfter moving to the west coast, Wu attended the University of California, San Diego. Working towards medical school, Wu began the research after her first year enrolled as a student but realized that she also wanted to pursue an MFA in the theater. There, over time she developed the accents of standard English, British/Polish/Slovakian, and some fluency in Cantonese and Mandarin. Wu graduated with a BS in Biochemistry, a BA in Humanities, a BA in Drama, and an MFA in Acting and Directing. She also later received a certification in video/film editing from The Edit Center and an AA in science and humanities from Mira Costa College.\nWu did not get involved with showbiz until 20 years after her move from the west coast. It was not until one of her old headshots happened to end up in a Homicide: Life on the Street episodic casting office that she finally surfaced within Hollywood. At the time, the show was shooting in Baltimore, Maryland. The executives called her in for an audition as they were looking for a Korean immigrant. Even during the late 1990s roles for Asian American actors were so sparse that it was rare to find trained Asians who were adequately eligible for the position posted. Wu was awarded a recurring role on the show, officially introducing her to the professional arena of television.\nJade Wu has since then, worked with actors such as; Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, George C. Wolf, Austin Pendleton, Jeanine Tesori, Jenifer Lewis, Ato Essandoh, Fred Weller, Geoff Arends, Tony Kushner, Ridley Scott, Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Tony Gilroy, Warren Leight, Paul McGuigan, Guerrmo Navarro, Vincenzo Natali, Peter Leto, Clark Johnson, Frank Prinzi, Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson. Wu also had recurring roles on One Life to Live, Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Bull, and The Blacklist. She has performed on stage as well, working in Off-Broadway theatre productions at The Public, Delacorte Theatre in Central Park, Urban Stages, Bank St. Theatre, Minetta Lane, The Wilma Theatre, Arena Stage, Shakespeare Theatre Washington DC, and La Jolla Stage. Wu played the lead role of Ahma Chin in a Sundance Sundance pedigree independent film, The Motel, which won the Humanitas Prize and an Independent Spirit Award Nomination.

        "Xi_Jinping": {
            "early_life": "Xi Jinping was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953, the second son of Xi Zhongxun and his wife Qi Xin. After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi's father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People's Congress. Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An'an (\u5b89\u5b89; \u0100n'\u0101n), born in 1952. Xi's father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.Xi went to the Beijing No. 25 School, and then Beijing Bayi School, in the 1960s. He became friends with Liu He, who attended Beijing No. 101 School in the same district, who later became China's vice-premier and a close advisor to Xi after he became China's paramount leader. In 1963, when he was aged 10, his father was purged from the CCP and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan. In May 1966, the Cultural Revolution cut short Xi's secondary education when all secondary classes were halted for students to criticise and fight their teachers. Student militants ransacked the Xi family home and one of Xi's sisters, Xi Heping, committed suicide from the pressure.Later, his mother was forced to publicly denounce his father, as he was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. His father was later imprisoned in 1968 when Xi was aged 15. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement. He worked as the party secretary of Liangjiahe, where he lived in a cave house. According to people who knew him, this experience led him to feel affinity with the rural poor. After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches, but later returned to the village, spending a total of seven years there.The misfortunes and suffering of his family in his early years hardened Xi's view of politics. During an interview in 2000, he said, \"People who have little contact with power, who are far from it, always see these things as mysterious and novel. But what I see is not just the superficial things: the power, the flowers, the glory, the applause. I see the bullpens and how people can blow hot and cold. I understand politics on a deeper level.\" The \"bullpens\" (\u725b\u68da) was a reference to Red Guards' detention houses during the Cultural Revolution.After being rejected seven times, Xi joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1971 by befriending a local official. He reunited with his father in 1972, because of a family reunion ordered by premier Zhou Enlai. From 1973, he applied to join the CCP ten times and was finally accepted on his tenth attempt in 1974. From 1975 to 1979, Xi studied chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student in Beijing. The engineering majors there spent about 15 percent of their time studying Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Mao Zedong thought and 5 percent of their time doing farm work and \"learning from the People's Liberation Army\".\nFrom 1979 to 1982, Xi served as secretary for his father's former subordinate Geng Biao, the then vice premier and secretary-general of the CMC. In 1982, he was sent to Zhengding County in Hebei as deputy party secretary of Zhengding County. He was promoted in 1983 to secretary, becoming the top official of the county. Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his regional political career: Hebei (1982\u20131985), Fujian (1985\u20132002), Zhejiang (2002\u20132007), and Shanghai (2007). Xi held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, he was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP. However, of the 151 alternate members of the Central Committee elected at the 15th Party Congress, Xi received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing him last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to his status as a princeling.From 1998 to 2002, Xi studied Marxist theory and ideological education in Tsinghua University, graduating with a doctorate in law and ideology in 2002. In 1999, he was promoted to the office of Vice Governor of Fujian, and became governor a year later. In Fujian, Xi made efforts to attract investment from Taiwan and to strengthen the private sector of the provincial economy. In February 2000, he and then-provincial party secretary Chen Mingyi were called before the top members of PSC \u2013 general secretary Jiang Zemin, premier Zhu Rongji, vice president Hu Jintao and Discipline Inspection secretary Wei Jianxing \u2013 to explain aspects of the Yuanhua scandal.In 2002, Xi left Fujian and took up leading political positions in neighbouring Zhejiang. He eventually took over as provincial Party Committee secretary after several months as acting governor, occupying a top provincial office for the first time in his career. In 2002, he was elected a full member of the 16th Central Committee, marking his ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, Xi presided over reported growth rates averaging 14% per year. His career in Zhejiang was marked by a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials. This earned him a name in the national media and drew the attention of China's top leaders. Between 2004 and 2007, Li Qiang acted as Xi's chief of staff through his position as secretary-general of the Zhejiang Party Committee, where they both developed close ties.Following the dismissal of Shanghai Party secretary Chen Liangyu in September 2006 due to a social security fund scandal, Xi was transferred to Shanghai in March 2007, where he was the party secretary there for seven months. In Shanghai, Xi avoided controversy and was known for strictly observing party discipline. For example, Shanghai administrators attempted to earn favour with him by arranging a special train to shuttle him between Shanghai and Hangzhou for him to complete handing off his work to his successor as Zhejiang party secretary Zhao Hongzhu. However, Xi reportedly refused to take the train, citing a loosely enforced party regulation that stipulated that special trains can only be reserved for \"national leaders\". While in Shanghai, he worked on preserving unity of the local party organisation. He pledged there would be no 'purges' during his administration, despite the fact many local officials were thought to have been implicated in the Chen Liangyu corruption scandal. On most issues, Xi largely echoed the line of the central leadership.\nXi's first marriage was to Ke Lingling, the daughter of Ke Hua, China's ambassador to the United Kingdom in the early 1980s. They divorced within a few years. The two were said to fight \"almost every day\", and after the divorce Ke moved to England. In 1987, Xi married the prominent Chinese folk singer Peng Liyuan. Xi and Peng were introduced by friends as many Chinese couples were in the 1980s. Xi was reputedly academic during their courtship, inquiring about singing techniques. Peng Liyuan, a household name in China, was better known to the public than Xi until his political elevation. The couple frequently lived apart due largely to their separate professional lives. Peng has played a much more visible role as China's \"first lady\" compared to her predecessors; for example, Peng hosted U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama on her high-profile visit to China in March 2014.Xi and Peng have a daughter named Xi Mingze, who graduated from Harvard University in the spring of 2015. While at Harvard, she used a pseudonym and studied Psychology and English. Xi's family has a home in Jade Spring Hill, a garden and residential area in north-western Beijing run by the CMC.In June 2012, Bloomberg News reported that members of Xi's extended family have substantial business interests, although there was no evidence he had intervened to assist them. The Bloomberg website was blocked in mainland China in response to the article. Since Xi embarked on an anti-corruption campaign, The New York Times reported members of his family were selling their corporate and real estate investments beginning in 2012. Relatives of highly placed Chinese officials, including seven current and former senior leaders of the Politburo of the CCP, have been named in the Panama Papers, including Deng Jiagui, Xi's brother-in-law. Deng had two shell companies in the British Virgin Islands while Xi was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, but they were dormant by the time Xi became general secretary of the CCP in November 2012.\nIt is hard to gauge the opinion of the Chinese public on Xi, as no independent surveys exist in China and social media is heavily censored. However, he is believed to be widely popular in the country. According to a 2014 poll co-sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, Xi ranked 9 out of 10 in domestic approval ratings. A YouGov poll released in July 2019 found that about 22% of people in mainland China list Xi as the person they admire the most, a plurality, although this figure was less than 5% for residents of Hong Kong. In the spring of 2019, the Pew Research Center made a survey on confidence on Xi Jinping among six-country medians based on Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines and South Korea, which indicated that a median 29% have confidence in Xi Jinping to do the right thing regarding world affairs, meanwhile a median of 45% have no confidence; these numbers are slightly higher than those of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (23% confidence, 53% no confidence). A poll by Politico and Morning Consult in 2021 found that 5% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Xi, 38% unfavorable, 17% no opinion and 40%, a plurality, never hearing of him.In 2017, The Economist named him the most powerful person in the world. In 2018, Forbes ranked him as the most powerful and influential person in the world, replacing Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been ranked so for five consecutive years. Since 2013, Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the stated aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information, included Xi among the list of press freedom predators.Unlike previous Chinese leaders, Chinese state media has given a more encompassing view of Xi's private life, although still strictly controlled. According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi would swim one kilometer and walk every day as long as there was time, and is interested in foreign writers, especially Russian. He is known to love films and TV shows such as Saving Private Ryan, The Departed, The Godfather and Game of Thrones, also praising the independent film-maker Jia Zhangke. The Chinese state media has also cast him as a fatherly figure and a man of the people, determined to stand up for Chinese interests.\n",

She then entered the Film Studies Program at the Communication University of China, where she completed her Master's thesis: \"A Study on Female Figures in Science Fiction Films\". Recently, she obtained a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and World Literature at Peking University, with \"Chinese Science Fiction and Its Cultural Politics Since 1990\" as the topic of her dissertation. She now teaches at School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University.During her collegiate life she began to write science fiction works and took part in student clubs for science fiction and fantasy fans. Her short stories have attracted critical acclaim from the outset, beginning with her early Chinese Galaxy Award recipient \"Guan Yaojing de Pingzi\" \u5173\u5996\u7cbe\u7684\u74f6\u5b50 (April 2004 Science Fiction World trans Linda Rui Feng as \"The Demon-Enslaving Flask\" November 2012 Renditions). A work of Fabulation, in which the Scientist James Clerk Maxwell (1831\u20131879) is offered a Faustian challenge by a literal demon, its selection was attended by a spat among critics as to whether it could be called sf at all. The story is mired so deeply in anecdotes from the history of science, and literal interpretations of famous thought experiments, that it requires copious footnotes to explain its own jokes (infodump). This, however, seems very much in keeping with the classical, didactic tradition in Chinese sf, creating a story whose fantasy elements are mere vectors to convey information about the life and work of icon figures such as Archimedes, Albert Einstein, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and Maxwell himself.Later work mirrored her personal academic journey from hard science into the creative arts. Her first longer work was  \"Jiuzhou Nil\u00fc\" \u4e5d\u5dde\u2022\u9006\u65c5 \"On the Road: Odyssey of China Fantasy\" (coll of linked stories 2009), part of the Jiuzhou shared-universe fantasy series. \"Bai Gui Ye Xing Jie\" \u767e\u9b3c\u591c\u884c\u8857 (August 2010  Science Fiction World trans Ken Liu as \"A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight\" February 2012 Clarkesworld) is far subtler and more mature, a child's eye view of life inside what first appears to be a haunted Keep redolent of Chinese ghost stories, but is gradually revealed as a run-down Far Future theme park populated with Cyborg simulacra.

His father was once an actor and then became a painter.Xia was initially discovered by Jiang Wen who cast him in his semi-autobiographical film In the Heat of the Sun (1994). Despite being chosen partly because of his facial resemblance to a young Jiang, Xia's spirited and moving performance as a renegade youth conquered audiences. He was rocketed to international stardom after he won the Best Actor award from the Venice Film Festival (the youngest actor to win that award in the history of the festival), Singapore International Film Festival and Golden Horse Awards.Xia wanted to study drama after his first film, he was accepted into the Central Academy of Drama. After completing his studies there, Xia remained an active force in Chinese cinema as well as television, appearing in many films and television series. Xia's second film Shadow Magic demonstrated his talent as an actor and earned him a nomination for Best Actor at the Tokyo International Film Festival. His earlier film credits also includes  Roots and Branches (2001) and Where Have All the Flowers Gone (2002). Xia's subsequent films, The Law of Romance (2003) won him a Golden Rooster Award for Best Actor and Waiting Alone (2005) earned him Best Actor at the Beijing College Student Film Festival. With five best actor titles at international film festivals, Xia Yu has been named one of the top 4 hottest young actors in China.Like many of today\u2032s actors in China, Xia Yu also has an extensive TV career, appearing on such shows as Records of Kangxi's Travel Incognito, Classical Romance and Sky Lovers. Most of Xia\u2032s TV roles have been secondary ones until he was cast to star in The Ugliest In the World, where he played Liu Baoshan, a genius of the Qing Dynasty who gave up the opportunity to become an official in order to become a clown.Aside from local productions, Xia has also starred in two Hollywood films; China: The Panda Adventure (2001) and The Painted Veil (2006). Xia also starred alongside Shilpa Shetty in the Indian-Chinese film The Desire (2010). In 2016, he took on the role of Wong Jack-man in the Bruce Lee biopic Birth of the Dragon, produced by American filmmaker George Nolfi.In 2017, Xia reunited with Waiting Alone director Dayyan Eng in fantasy comedy film Wished, which became one of the highest-grossing domestic comedy titles for the summer season.In 2019, it was announced that Xia will play Shen Gongbao in the upcoming fantasy film series Fengshen Trilogy directed by Wuershan. The film is based on the novel Investiture of the Gods.\nXia Yu married actress Yuan Quan in 2009, a decade after their first date as students in Central Academy of Drama. They have appeared in 4 films together: The Law of Romance (2003), Waiting Alone (2004), Shanghai Rumba (2006) and Breakup Buddies (2014).

            "early_life": "Xia received, in 1982, from Nanjing University a bachelor's degree in astronomy and in 1988, a PhD in mathematics from Northwestern University with thesis advisor Donald G. Saari, for his thesis, The Existence of the Non-Collision Singularities. From 1988 to 1990, Xia was an assistant professor at Harvard University and from 1990 to 1994, an associate professor at Georgia Institute of Technology (and Institute Fellow). In 1994, he became a full professor at Northwestern University and since 2000, he has been the Arthur and Gladys Pancoe Professor of Mathematics.His research deals with celestial mechanics, dynamical systems, Hamiltonian dynamics, and ergodic theory. In his dissertation, he solved the Painlev\u00e9 conjecture, a long-standing problem posed in 1895 by Paul Painlev\u00e9. The problem concerns the existence of singularities of non-collision character in the \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  -body problem in three-dimensional space; Xia proved the existence for \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        \u2265\n        5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N\\geq 5}\n  . For the existence proof, he constructed an example of five masses, of which four are separated into two pairs which revolve around each other in eccentric elliptical orbits about the z-axis of symmetry, and a fifth mass moves along the z-axis. For selected initial conditions, the fifth mass can be accelerated to an infinite velocity in a finite time interval (without any collision between the bodies involved in the example). The case \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        =\n        4\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N=4}\n   was open until 2014, when it was solved by Jinxin Xue.

However, Painlev\u00e9's proof did not extend to the case \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        >\n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N>3}\n  .\nIn 1993, Xia was the inaugural winner of the Blumenthal Award of the American Mathematical Society.

Xiao's original interest was the Yuan dynasty, but from the mid-1980s he turned his attention to the history of the late Qing and early Republican periods.In his early academic career, Xiao studied the thought of Yan Fu, an influential Chinese scholar and Westerniser of this era, questioning the negative historical reputation that had become attached to Yan because of his later support for conservative projects such as Yuan Shikai's attempted monarchist restoration. Xiao came to the conclusion that Yan was a consistent incremental reformist who had struck a middle course between outright reaction and the wholesale abandonment of China's national identity. Building on his work on Yan, Xiao went on to make a broader reevaluation of the fall of the Qing dynasty, arguing that the Hundred Days' Reform of 1898 failed primarily not because of the conservatism of Cixi but because of the radicalism of Kang Youwei and his allies.\n",

In 1975, near the end of the Cultural Revolution, he was relocated to the countryside for two years as part of Mao Zedong's \"re-education\" policy. Returning to Beijing in 1977, he enrolled at the Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA) in Beijing, where he joined the printmaking department and also worked during a short period of time as a teacher, receiving his master's degree in Fine Art in 1987. After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, his recent work came under scrutiny from the government and received harsh criticism for what was perceived as a critique of the Chinese government. Due to the political pressure and artistic restrictions of the post-Tiananmen period in China, Xu Bing, like many of his contemporaries, moved to the United States in 1990 where he was invited by the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. He then resided to the United States until his appointment as vice-president of the Beijing CAFA in 2008.\nIn 1990\u201391, Xu had his first exhibition in the United States at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison's Elvehjem Museum of Art (now Chazen Museum of Art) including his installations A Book from the Sky and Ghosts Pounding the Wall. In Book from the Sky, the artist invented 4,000 characters and hand-carved them into wood blocks, then used them as movable type to print volumes and scrolls, which are displayed laid out on the floor and hung from the ceiling. The vast planes of text seem to convey ancient wisdom, but are in fact unintelligible. The Glassy Surface of a Lake, a site-specific installation for the Elvehjem, was on view in 2004\u201305. In this work, a net of cast aluminum letters forming a passage from Henry David Thoreau's Walden stretches across the museum's atrium and pours down into an illegible pile of letters on the floor below.\nWorking in a wide range of media, Xu creates installations that question the idea of communicating meaning through language, demonstrating how both meanings and written words can be easily manipulated. He received a MacArthur Foundation grant in July 1999, presented to him for \"originality, creativity, self-direction, and capacity to contribute importantly to society, particularly in printmaking and calligraphy.\"\nIn 2003 he exhibited at the then new Chinese Arts centre in Manchester, and in 2004 he won the inaugural \"Artes Mundi\" prize in Wales for Where does the dust collect itself?, an installation using dust he collected in New York City on the day after the destruction of the World Trade Center.

            "early_life": "On April 16, 1974, Xu was born in Beijing, China. \nXu graduated from Beijing Film Academy in 1997. She later returned as a teacher at the Performing Department.Xu grew up with her parents and her younger brother. Xu Jinglei's father Xu Zijian and his mother Yu Shurong are both middle-class workers. Her Father, Xu Zijian is the director of the Great Wall Neon Factory in Beijing.\nXu was recommended to a middle school in Beijing's Chaoyang District because of her extraordinary calligraphy skills. However, she didn't like calligraphy, but was forced by her father to study in the calligraphy class in Beijing Children's Palace to practice calligraphy every day and recite poems of Tang poetry under the strict education of her father. As a child, Xu was not confident at all, and she never thought of being an actress or director.Later, Xu Jinglei fell in love with painting. When she was 17, she spent a long time commuting to learn painting and determined to study make-up as a major in the Stage Art department of The Central Academy of Drama. However, she was not admitted by The Central Academy of Drama, but was instead admitted to the acting department of Beijing Film Academy, starting her career of acting and directing later.\nIn 1994, she first entered the film industry by starring in the TV series \"My Deskmate\". Xu Jinglei rose to fame in China with the television series A Sentimental Story (1997), where she played a policewoman who falls for a gangster. Thereafter, she starred in romance film Spicy Love Soup (1997), where she won the Society Award at the Golden Phoenix Awards for her performance. In 1998, she was elected the third most popular contemporary actress among college students and the top 10 stunners of the New Weekly. In the same year, she took part in the TV drama \"Love to the End\". Xu solidified her success in 2002 with the films Spring Subway and I Love You, both popular hits in China and particularly with younger audiences.\nIn 1998, Xu and actor Li Yapeng paired up in Cherish Our Love Forever, a story based on the life and love between a group of young college students. The television series struck a chord with young audiences and became a massive hit in China, where Xu and Li were hailed as the \"Nation's Couple\". The two would later pair up again for the film sequel Eternal Moment (2011), set ten years after the drama.Xu solidified her success in 2002 with the films Spring Subway and I Love You, both popular hits in China and particularly with younger audiences. Along with Zhang Ziyi, Zhou Xun and Zhao Wei, Xu was hailed as one of the Four Dan Actresses in China. Xu won the Huabiao Award for Outstanding New Actress for her performance in I Love You and the Hundred Flowers Award for Best Actress for Spring Subway. The same year, she won the Golden Rooster Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in Far from Home.In June 2005, Time named Xu Jinglei as the only Chinese director and actor in an article entitled \"China's New Revolution\", and called her \"a representative revolutionary figure in the Chinese film industry\".In 2006, Xu starred alongside Takeshi Kaneshiro, Tony Leung and Shu Qi in the crime drama Confession of Pain. She received her first acting award in Hong Kong; the year's Most Attractive Actress at the Hong Kong Society of Cinematographers (HKSC) Awards. Xu was then cast as the female lead in the war epic, The Warlords (2007) by Peter Chan.After an extended hiatus from acting, Xu made a comeback in the science fiction thriller Battle of Memories (2017).\nXu made her directorial debut with the film My Father and I (2003), where she also starred as the lead actress. The film, which tackled the delicate relationship between a Chinese father and his daughter, received widespread critical acclaim and won her a Golden Rooster for Best Directing Debut. Her second directorial work, Letter from an Unknown Woman (2004) was a romantic story based on the classic novel of Stefan Zweig, and won her the Silver Shell for Best Director at the San Sebastian International Film Festival in Spain.After two successful art-house films, Xu had a shot in innovative film making in Dreams Come True (2006),  an experimental film shot in one setting. However unlike her previous two films, Dreams Come True was panned by critics.Xu became the first female director in China whose films gross more than 100 million yuan, for her 2010 film Go Lala Go!. The film, adapted from Li Ke's bestseller of the same name which is about a young woman's growth in society, is Xu's first attempt at commercial production. Go Lala Go! shows the life of middle-class, revealing the accelerated pace of the society as well as the degradation of the social welfare system as a consequence of the rise of neoliberal mindset. The ideology difference between Go Lala Go! and My Father and I indicates a transition of China's old society to the new society, articulating the social reconstruction of China.In 2014,  Xu Jinglei, as the only female director, ranked fifth on the Chinese directors value list, which selected from mainland directors who have independently directed five or more films in theaters in the past two decades. Xu appears as  \"the first female director who has directed six films independently and has earned more than 100 million yuan at the domestic box office and won the international Film Festival awards\" on the list. Some industry insiders said that although the persistent exploration of literary avant-garde themes may affect her box office performance, the 36.25 percent return rate confirms the significant effect of \"director Xu Jinglei\" in the audiences' mind.Xu continued to direct romantic features Dear Enemy (2011) and Somewhere Only We Know (2015), which were moderately successful at the box office.Deviating from her former productions which mainly focuses on romance and family, Xu returned with action cop thriller The Missing in 2017. She also announced that she would be producing an alien-themed online comedy series based on the popular online novel \"My 200-Million-Year-Old Classmate\". This is China's first science fiction school-themed online drama, adapted from the novel of the same name, talking about a story of an alien named Abdouri takes over a high school girl, Xuan Mo's body. First time acting as the producer of a web series, Xu indicates that she didn't do it on a whim, but instead hopes to make a movie-like web series. She chose to work on this series because she saw the uniqueness of the characters and the setting of the story and want to create a milestone for Chinese television industry. For best results, Xu called in her own film crew to help. In addition, in order to present the perfect science fiction special effects in this school youth drama with science fiction elements, Xu Jinglei also invited Nick Hsieh, an international special effects supervisor who has participated in the production of blockbusters such as Pacific Rim and Star Wars, as the special effects director.\n",

Her father was constantly on business travel, thus leaving Ye to be cared for by her mother solely. When Ye was seven years old, her father moved overseas and only returned home for a total number of weeks within a year. Ye's parents divorced when she was nine years old. Her mother no longer wanted to care for her and instead wanted Ye's father to know what it was like to take care of their child.Ye then lived with her paternal grandparents. Her grandparents were retired professors who lived in a professor's hostel in the university. She was loved and spoiled by her grandparents, but her grandfather was extremely strict with her academics. Under his guidance, her academic results were good. Ye was involved in a lot of school activities.At the age of 10, her father brought her grandparents and Ye to New York City. Ye's father told her that a man's career is first priority and bringing her to the States would allow her to have a better education. Ye's grandparents could not acclimate to the new environment and returned to China. Her father was still busy with his career. She stated that initially she did hate her father. At the age of 13, Ye suggested to move out, claiming she did not want to live with a stranger. Her father agreed and let her rent an apartment. Every month she would go to her father's company for spending money. She would take care of laundry and meals herself. To earn extra money for other expenses, she lied about her age to work in a video rental store. Whilst at the store, she would often rent numerous series and movies to watch, which eventually influenced her to work in the entertainment business.She attended John Dewey High School. While there, she learned to speak Cantonese from a classmate. She won first place at the International Science and Engineering Fair in the Botany sector in 1998.

His mother came to the U.S. in 1988 to seek a better life and opportunities. Hernandez played baseball and soccer throughout his youth and was allegedly assigned a scout for a major league team at 13 but his mother declined because she did not trust a stranger taking her son at a young age. Hernandez and his older brother, Oscar Osiris (born August 25, 1994), were raised in a church throughout their youth. Hernandez sang during mass and was selected many times to read from the Bible. His favorite passage was Psalm 121. His elementary school, was Public School 59. His middle school was Juan Morel Campos Secondary School. His high school was Legacy High School. He left high school around the tenth grade.Hernandez did not know his father until he was 9 years old and had only a brief relationship with him. Hernandez's mother told him he was dead, according to Hernandez's father. Hernandez's father had a heroin addiction and was in prison for five years for selling drugs. Hernandez's stepfather, who also was Puerto Rican, was shot dead steps away from the family home in 2010. After the murder of his stepfather, Hernandez's mother was not able to make enough money working to support her children. She applied for welfare and there were many nights Hernandez and his brother went to bed without dinner. Due to his mother's financial struggle, Hernandez and his brother wore used clothes and Hernandez had to share a bed with his mother.Emotionally disturbed by the death of his stepfather, Hernandez would not shower or eat to the point where he lost a lot of weight, he was given therapy and was hospitalized for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Hernandez also started to act out due to his stepfather's death and was eventually expelled from school in the 8th grade for bad behavior. Rather than continuing his education, he started working at various jobs such as being a busboy and a delivery boy at a grocery store to help his mother financially.\nHernandez first decided to rap in 2012 after meeting Peter \"Righteous P\" Rodgers, CEO of New York record label Hikari-Ultra, when he came into the vegan bodega Hernandez was working at in Bushwick, Brooklyn and asked if Hernandez rapped based on his appearance, stating that he thought he had the image of a rapper and suggested that he rap because of this, along with Hernandez' cadence.Hernandez began releasing rap songs in 2014, starting with \"69\" in August 2014, \"Pimpin\", in September 2014 and both \"Who The Fuck is You\" and \"4769\" in October 2014, the latter of which was his first collaboration as a lead artist featuring two rappers from the Brooklyn collective Pro Era, J.A.B. and Dirty Sanchez. Over the next three years, he released multiple tracks and videos with titles such as \"Scumlife\", \"Shinigami\" (named after the Japanese death god Shinigami from Death Note), \"Yokai\" and \"Hellsing Station\", drawing attention for his aggressive rapping style and use of anime as music video visuals. Many of his early songs were released by FCK THEM, a music label based in Slovakia. He adopted the stage name \"Tekashi69\"; \"Tekashi\" references Japanese anime, which he was a fan of, while \"69\" references both the 69 sex position and the yin-yang symbol.Gathering fame as an internet meme for his rainbow-dyed hair, extensive tattoos and rainbow-plated grills, he eventually became an associate of fellow New York rapper ZillaKami, the younger half-brother of Righteous P. They later feuded after Hernandez discovered Righteous P and ZillaKami were going to sign a record deal with Epic, in an attempt by ZillaKami to drop him due to a lack of control over Hernandez, alleged unpaid bail money, the surfacing of misconduct allegations against Hernandez, and a dispute over allegedly stolen instrumentals. Soon after Hernandez began working with Andrew Green a rapper known as TrifeDrew, again, who had previously worked with him on music videos to work on videos again along with music.\nHernandez can speak Spanish; he sang in Spanish on four tracks, \"Bebe\" and \"Mala\" with Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA in 2018, \"Yaya\" in 2020, and \"Bori\" with Cuban singer Lenier in 2023. Hernandez suffers from asthma.Hernandez was raised as a Christian. In an interview with American radio personality Angie Martinez, he stated: \"I pray a lot; I always thank God for good situations. Every time there's a good situation, there's a cell in my brain that says: 'Say thank you to God'. ... Before I blew up, for a year and a half\u2014400 and something days\u2014I literally prayed every day while walking my dog Titus. I would pray every day: God, please change my life ... God, please change my life; I'm a good kid. Please change my life. I got a baby; I can't even buy her Pampers ... please change my life, please change my life\u2014and then 'Gummo' came and life changed. And then I was like damn, God is real. I knew if I prayed every day it would work because God is real. And my life has changed.\"In March 2018, Hernandez conducted a radio interview on The Breakfast Club, alongside Australian pastor Brian Houston. In this interview, the pastor held hands with Hernandez and prayed for him; asking God to help Hernandez make wise decisions and to bless his family.At 18 years old, Hernandez had a daughter, who was born on October 29, 2015, with Sara Molina (born January 17, 1996). Hernandez has another daughter who was born November 19, 2018, with Marlayna M.\nA few weeks before Hernandez headed to prison at the end of 2018, he began dating Rachel \"Jade\" Watley. She has Hernandez's face tattooed twice on her body.On October 1, 2020, Hernandez was reportedly hospitalized after having an overdose from mixing two Hydroxycut diet pills with a McDonald's McCaf\u00e9 coffee. He has claimed that he came to weigh more than 200 lbs after leaving prison but has said that using the medication had helped him shed 30 lbs since he was released. His lawyer denies the overdose claim.In September 2022, Hernandez became the goalkeeper of the Russian media football team GOATS.In March 2023, Hernandez was reportedly assaulted inside a steam room at an LA Fitness gym in Palm Beach County, Florida. Videos of the attack were shared on social media. Hernandez sustained facial cuts and had to be hospitalized. No one has been arrested for the attack so far.\n",

He began his musical career in his bedroom at his parents' house in Rez\u00e9.\nIn 1995, Richard and Cambia released their first mixtape, Premi\u00e8re Formule. Recorded in a makeshift studio, the first self-produced cassette was sold in the courtyard of their school. In 1997, they associated with DJ Greem, a high school friend of Richard's, to form the group Hocus Pocus, and released their first album as a trio, Seconde Formule, in 1998. Hocus Pocus mixes elements specific to hip-hop (scratches, samples, rap) to an instrumental sound influenced by jazz, soul and funk. Alongside Hocus Pocus, they created in collaboration with DJ Atom and DJ Pfel, a group called C2C (also known as \"Coups2Cross\"). C2C was the world champion DMC team four years in a row from 2003 to 2006. They found the collaboration of two MCs and a DJ did not work on stage and went their separate ways; Richard continued his production as 20syl and DJ Greem invested specifically in C2C.In 2001, Richard worked again with DJ Greem and Cambia on stage as Hocus Pocus. The same year, they created the label On & On and released the maxi Sick, which sold around 4000 copies. Three years later, they released the album 73 Touches (in reference to the number of piano keys). Largely influenced by jazz, they refer to Miles Davis and Billie Holiday. Mathieu Leli\u00e8vre on keyboard, Herv\u00e9 Godard on bass and David Le Deunff on guitar complement the trio. The same album was reissued in 2006 with a new version of Sick and six new titles.\n\nThe album Place 54, released in October 2007, increased their willingness to create acoustic hip-hop. For this album, they signed with the label Motown France to promote and distribute it. The album was well received and attracted interest from mainstream TV and radio. In 2008, Hocus Pocus was nominated for a Victoires de la Musique award in the category \"Urban Music Album of the Year\".Richard published his first solo EP, Motifs, on the 9 June 2014; the site sourdoreille.net considers this EP as \"a real gem\" whilst wordplaymagazine.com praises Richard's style as \"frankly remarkable\". His second EP, Motifs II, was published on 11 May 2015. Regarding the cover of Motifs II Richard explains: \"For the first volume, I played on the contrast between the zebra and the checkerboard. For this one, I wanted another animal. I like animals with a solemn air, which release an aesthetic force. When I came across this owl, I found him mysterious and chic. I also chose the motif of the opposition in the checkered plumage. It is a way to symbolize the two aspects of my music: electronic and organic. This refined and enigmatic image raises questions.\"In July 2015 in Nantes, Richard presented the U, an interactive musical skateboard ramp (in collaboration with the collective Herrmutt Lobby). herrmuttlobby.com says regarding U \"The skater is the musician and the ramp is the instrument. He composes and decomposes the rhythm, he breaks down initial binary arrangements, making the digital human again for a moment.\" In September 2015 The Apple Keynote used a piece of Richard's music to promote the functionality of Siri on the Apple Watch in their \"Choose Colorfully\" advertisement. In late 2015, Richard published a remix of the PLPS song How I Feel. In January 2016, he published his first year production entitled Inertia. Also in January 2016, he published a remix of the song Walk Walk by Yael Naim.\n\nIn 2015 he formed the group AllttA (A Little Lower Than The Angels) with the Californian rapper Mr. J. Medeiros.

            "early_life": "Born in New York City to West African parents from Cameroon, he was raised in the Eastchester section of the Bronx and later in West Hempstead on Long Island, where he attended high school. 88-Keys first took an interest in hip hop after hearing Prince Paul's production on De La Soul's 1989 critically acclaimed album 3 Feet High and Rising. In the early 1990s, 88-Keys met rapper-producers Q-Tip, Pete Rock and Large Professor working as an intern at West Hempstead's The Music Palace recording studio. It was Large Professor who gave Charles his 88-Keys moniker after witnessing his skills on the Ensoniq ASR-10 keyboard.Upon considering a serious career in music, 88-Keys's parents and older brother began trying to point him into the field of medicine because it was a more \"professional field\" and the music industry didn't seem like a lucrative move. After briefly attending Hofstra University and Queens College, 88-Keys dropped out to pursue his dreams of being a record producer. His decision was fueled by an opportunity to record some tracks with The Pharcyde who were recording in California. 88-Keys currently resides in Harlem, New York with his wife and two daughters.\nIn addition to his passion for music, 88-Keys has expressed his love for fashion, most notably Ralph Lauren. During an interview with Metro 88-Keys revealed that he has worn Polo Ralph Lauren every day for 16 years.\n\nI try to stay true to Ralph's vision. I don't want to bastardize his vision \u2013 no offense to the urban community \u2013 because we all know what happened to Tommy Hilfiger once the hip hop community embraced it. I'll walk out of the door dressed in loafers when everyone else is wearing Timberland boots. I definitely stand out. I'll tag along with Kanye on shopping trips and look at clothing by designers whose names I'd need to take French lessons to pronounce. He'll ask me what I think and I'll be like, whatever. I've turned down paying gigs because they've tried to dress me in clothing by other designers. Besides record shopping, the only other place I need is a Polo store. I'll go to Paris and they ll be like, 'here's the Eiffel Tower' and I'm like, 'whatever, where's the record store and the Polo store.\nAccording to the article, 88-Keys began wearing Polo Ralph Lauren as a Long Island high school student in 1992 when he developed a liking for its classic, preppy style. Since then, he's worn a complete look from the brand every day, without fail. His wardrobe includes over 700 Polo pieces.Since his days as an assistant engineer, 88-Keys has produced records for numerous artists including Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Kid Cudi, Macy Gray, Musiq Soulchild, Dejuan Lucian and Consequence. Recently, 88-Keys extended beyond his production credits to highlight his skills on the mic as MC, singer and collaborator, most notably on his solo debut album The Death of Adam released on November 11, 2008. Executively produced by 88-Keys's close friend Kanye West, the concept album tells the story of a man named Adam who has been murdered in a loft apartment in Harlem. In August 2008 a fifteen-track mixtape titled Adam's Case Files was released as a prequel to The Death of Adam. The album's first single titled \"Stay Up! (Viagra)\" was officially released through iTunes on September 9, 2008. In December 2008, 88-Keys was highlighted as Spin Artist of the Day. In 2009, 88-Keys worked in Atlanta with new female duo Addictive on a track for a forthcoming album.\nIn June 2019, 88-Keys announced that a song he produced titled \"That's Life\", featuring Sia and Mac Miller, had been approved for release by Miller's estate, and was released through Warner Records on June 20, 2019.\n",

While there, he made connections with local rappers such as Lil Yachty through his friendships with JWitDaBeam and Slimesito. He returned to New York in 2016 to attend Hostos Community College, playing basketball for the school's team, but his interest in music led him to return to Atlanta that same year where the hip hop scene had been heating up with the advent of trap's rise in popularity. The numbers in his name came from his building number in the Bronx, while the letters are his first and last initials.With a few songs under his belt, Rochez realized he needed a way to stand out. He first employed his signature squeaky voice in the 2018 single \"Crack\". The song garnered attention when its video was reposted by fellow New Yorker Lil Tecca, including from the music industry. This led to the release of his self-titled debut album in 2019, and the single \"4 da Trap\" later in the year. \"4 da Trap\" spread virally across the internet, even leading Twitter to suspend 645AR's account because they assumed it was spam.

            "early_life": "In 1999, when A-Lin was 16 years old and taught children to sing the hymn \"Amazing Grace\" after the 1999 Jiji earthquake in Nantou County, she was discovered by her former agent. However, he was not available when she wanted to give him contact information. Fortunately, four years later, A-Lin met him again in a bar where she sang regularly. She was officially offered a singing contract.A-Lin made her debut in the world of music at the end of 2006, achieving rapid commercial success. She has been called the next A-Mei, who is an aboriginal singer of Puyuma descent. She also got the nickname \u5929\u751f\u6b4c\u59ec, meaning \"A Born Diva\". A-Lin was often quoted as saying that A-Mei is highly influential to her music and often covers A-Mei's songs in music shows and concerts. A-Lin has won numerous music awards and is extremely popular within Mandarin-speaking world.A-Lin has performed internationally and at a sold-out concert with Xiao Yu and Shin in 2012 at the Sydney Town Hall. It was her first visit to Sydney and people flew in from different cities just to see her.In 2013, with Avex Taiwan exiting the market due to overall poor sales from the records, all singers under Avex like Huang Li-ling were allowed to terminate their contracts early.After terminating her contract, A-Lin signed with her new label Sony Music. In December 2014, she released her first album after leaving Avex. This album was nominated for Best Mandarin Female Singer, making her fourth nomination without any win.In 2015, she participated in the third season of I Am a Singer and came in sixth on the finale held in March 2015. As a result, her singing ability was recognized by more people and provided a boost to her career.\nA-Lin is the youngest in her family. Her parents are Roman Catholics and love music. A-Lin's older sister is Taiwanese model Luji Huang, who entered the Super Star competition in Taiwan in July 2013 as an aspiring singer in her own right. In 2015, after A-Lin entered I Am A Singer, Lea became a contestant for 'The most beautiful harmonies' (\u6700\u7f8e\u548c\u8072). They also have an older brother, and A-Lin's cousin-in-law is her fitness coach and also a guitarist. A-Lin was extremely popular as a student and the confidence she gained from this led to her decision to compete in a 'Singing Strength Elite Rivalry Competition' [\u6b4c\u5531\u5be6\u529b\u7cbe\u82f1\u89d2\u9010\u6bd4\u8cfd]. She chose the hit song 'At least you are still there' [\u81f3\u5c11\u9084\u6709\u4f60], by Sandy Lam, and the competition allowed A-Lin to believe she had a future as a professional singer. In reference to talent shows being readily accessible to young people these days, A-Lin commented, \"I am impressed that there is now a Million Star-type of singing platform, which allows both everyone who enjoys singing and those who are talented singers a tough but realistic chance - an accomplished dream.\" They also have a brother.On 1 July 2007, A-Lin married Huang Kan-lin, a well-known Taiwanese baseball player. They have a daughter, Huang Qiaoyu. (A-Lin said: \"At the first time Huang Kan-lin requested a song \"How Do I Live\"  by LeAnn Rimes in her Tainan Pub Session. However, at that time because of his poor English, he wrote \u201cGood Do A-Lin \" on a piece of paper and then spelled the song in homophonic Mandarin. The implication was that he wanted to chase after A-Lin because of her rich lips. Eventually, Huang Kan-lin proposed to A-Lin successfully by a new recorded song \"\u611b\u60c5\u554f\u600e\u9ebc\u8d70 (How Love Will Go)\").\n",

            "early_life": "A1one grew up in Iran during a period of war and the Khatami reform era (1997\u20132005). A1one studied for 5 years at the Faculty of Art and Architecture in one of the Universities in Tehran. While still a student, he began painting graffiti on the walls of his campus, as a protest against students' conditions.  He was eventually expelled by the University's principal following a disagreement over religious restrictions.After being expelled from the University, his graffiti activities in the city of Tehran increased. A1one was the first person to start painting on the city walls. Therefore, his name can be interpreted as \"Alone\" or \"First One\". A1one started painting walls in the late 1990s. He is the pioneer of the urban art scene in the Middle East. When he began, it was a time when nobody knew what graffiti was in his country. He had a very influential role in the rise of street art and stenciling within Iran. Already involved in urban arts in general, he met the rapper, Nima, in 2005, who told him everything about the graffiti culture, which triggered A1one's desire to grow in that direction. His first significant work was a painting under the Tehran-Karaj expressway called Searching for Friends.He started his street art project in 2003 and inspired his close friends at that time to also begin painting on the streets. Artists such as Elle, isba, K.T., and Magoi were the first people to join him in Tehran. With his public space art, he describes his view on Iranian society and puts himself regularly in danger.\n\"When I decided to do my painting on walls I bought some spray cans \u2013 at that time we had just some very low-quality colors in Iran. My first work was a very simple work titled \"searching for friends\" painted on a wall right next to the Tehran-Karaj expressway late at night. It was a frightening night for me\u2026 The next morning I got three calls from friends who recognized my style of painting. They were shocked to see my work on a public wall. My first stencil was a Munch's Scream Print on Art University walls and after that, experimented with many techniques and methods, but I continue with stencils, graffiti, and sticker art.\"\nIn 2007, he was invited to illustrate the cover of a book, Young and Defiant in Iran; a contemporary ethnographic work by Shahram Khosravi. In 2008, he was invited to show his work at the annual Melbourne Stencil Festival, taking 40 pieces of work with him to his first trip in a non-dictatorship country, thus experimenting exhibiting his artwork without the fear of reprisals for the first time.By 2010, A1One was an established name within Tehran's youth culture and a key figure in the emergence of Iranian street art.\n",

            "early_life": "Amy Furuhara grew up in a rural community in Nagano Prefecture. She first became interested in music when she joined the light music club in high school, where she primarily played the drums. Furuhara was inspired by musicians such as M.I.A. and T-Pain who she heard after traveling to Canada as an exchange student in 2008, and by final year of high school she had begun composing songs. Following high school, Furuhara attended the Kanda University of International Studies, where she spent up to 14 hours per day speaking English, and later a flight attendant school for Air Canada in Vancouver. She returned to Japan as Air Canada required at least three years of work experience, and worked as an English conversation teacher in Osaka. Furuhara started creating music when she was 22 when she returned to Japan. Inspired by the music she heard in Canada and having some experience using GarageBand, she decided to start a Tokyo-based <<electropop band>> called Go Retro with her friend Shiori Ogawa in 2013. Her bandmate Ogawa played the drums and used a Kaoss Pad for their live performances, while Furuhara performed on the synthesizer. Furuhara decided to start singing as the band's vocalist, so that she could lessen the work that Ogawa needed to do. The band released two demos and performed concerts around the Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka areas, and received a development contract from a record label, where Furuhara was given vocal training lessons. After a year together, the band broke up, as Ogawa decided to return home to Osaka.Shortly after Go Retro's dissolution in 2014, Furuhara was approached by a DJ called Takuma, and together they formed the group Eemie, producing exclusively English-language music. Initially self-releasing electro/chillwave music on Bandcamp, the group debuted on independent label Maxtreme Records in 2015 with the single \"Carnival\", and were listed among AP Japan's 36 Bands You Need To Know 2015. Eemie performed at the Summer Sonic summer rock festival in 2015. In 2015, Furuhara met the psychedelic pop/rock group Tempalay, and was invited to perform as a live support member of their band. Furuhara toured the US, performing both as a part of Tempalay and as a member of Eemie in March 2016 (including a performance at South by Southwest). In August 2016 the band disbanded, performing a final concert on August 31, where the band also released their debut and final album.\nFuruhara began her solo career in February 2017 as Aaamyyy, after becoming a radio DJ on InterFM's programme Tokyo Scene, where she debuted her song \"8PM\". For her solo career, she decided to sing in Japanese, as a way to reach listeners more easily in Japan. Aaamyyy released her debut extended play Weekend EP in September on cassette, recording the entire release on her phone, using the iOS app Figure. This was followed by the Maborosi EP in February 2018, as well as a compilation release of this plus her debut EP, entitled Maborosi Weekend, which was her first widely distributed release in Japan.In June, Furuhara officially became a member of Tempalay, which lead to the band releasing the extended play Nante Subarashiki Sekai in September, featuring Furuhara as the band's synthesizer player, and as their occasional background vocalist. Aaamyyy's final of her three EP series, the Etcetra EP, was released digitally and on cassette in October.Aaamyyy began recording her debut album Body in October 2018, releasing it in February 2019. A concept album set in 2615, the release was inspired by Netflix television shows such as Black Mirror and Maniac (2018). The album featured collaborations with American musician Computer Magic, New York-based group JIL and Japanese group Paellas' vocalist Matton. Tempalay's third album With Love from the 21 Century was released in June, and was the band's most commercially successful work to date, reaching #30 on Oricon's weekly charts.In March 2020, Aaamyyy collaborated with musician Shin Sakiura for the song \"Night Running\", which was used as the ending theme song for the Netflix anime series BNA: Brand New Animal.In July 2022, Aaamyyy released her fourth EP digitally, entitled ECHO CHAMBER.\nFuruhara adopted the English name Amy while living in Canada.\n",

The trumpet concerto Blue Phrases (2007), the sinfonietta The Season of Blue Light and quartet Blue Fragments (2008) are additional examples of Aagard-Nilsen's expressive focus; while the orchestral work Boreas Sings (2012) represents a new direction in which a spectrum of colours and dancing rhythms become evident. 2014 saw his orchestral work Boreas Bl\u00e6s (2014) premiered by the Norwegian Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra at the opening ceremony of Stormen, Bod\u00f8's concert hall.In 2016 Aagard-Nilsen received the Norwegian Music Publishing Association's Annual Award for his work Dirty Dancing, commissioned and premiered by the Christiania Bl\u00e5seensemble in 2015.\n",

Ahmad Aali came to Tehran in 1949 and first studied painting and drawing at the Conservatory of Visual Arts and later in the free classes of Kamal Al-Molk Conservatory. After his initial acquaintance with the camera, he gradually became fascinated with it and gradually began to learn technical issues in photography. In the mid-1950s, he became acquainted with world-renowned photographers through foreign photo magazines and was influenced by new ideas. Aali held his first solo exhibition, including photographs with new perspectives and compositions, at the Culture Hall in 1963 and has since held several solo and group exhibitions. Having a close relationship with Iranian modernist painters and sculptors, he took a formalistic and modernist look at his work, emphasizing that photography was not a mere copy of reality. One of the significant innovations in Iranian photography was the creation of mosaic combinations of photographs that did not correspond to classical photography methods. He exhibited this collection of his works for the first time in 1968 in Seyhoun Gallery. Another part of his works includes documentary photographs, which simultaneously found a general and human face due to repetition and sequence. After the revolution, he spent more time on his painting experiences, which are generally hyper-realistic, and many of his works were done in the form of paintings on photographs. In 1997, many of his pictures were exhibited in the review exhibition of Ahmad Aali's works, and 2010, 2012, and 2016, he held solo exhibitions of his new and old works.\nHis work is in numerous public museum collections, such as the British Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), among others.\n",

She entered the faculty of theology at the University of Helsinki in 1973.\nAalto was the vicar of the Imatra parish from 1986 to 2010.In November 2008, Aalto came out as trans woman and announced her intent to have sex reassignment surgery. According to Aalto, her parents had decided to give her the name Marja-Sisko if she had been born a girl, as they had hoped. She was preoccupied with the issue of gender from the age of three. Although her parents had wanted a girl, they did not accept her gender identity. For example, they were angry when Aalto, as a child, asked why she could not wear a skirt when all the other girls did.Aalto's coming out as a trans woman caused a great controversy in the Church. The bishop of Mikkeli, Voitto Huotari, commented that there is no juridical obstacle for Aalto continuing as a vicar, but predicted that there would be problems. In 2009, almost 600 members left the Imatra parish. In November 2009, Aalto returned to the job of vicar after spending a year on leave. In March 2010, she requested to be allowed to resign, due in part to the discrimination she faced.She was elected the notary of diocese for Kuopio by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in 2010.\nSince her resignation as vicar, Aalto has pursued a career as a writer of detective fiction.

            "early_life": "Boyd was born and raised in the small rural town of Morton, Mississippi. She grew up singing and honing her vocals in a local church. She graduated from Morton High School in the Scott County School District in 1984. A few years later, she and her best friend made a decision to move out west to pursue a singing/music career together. The friend ended up getting pregnant and Boyd relocated to Oakland, California. It wasn't long after this relocation that Boyd was discovered by producer (and future husband) James Earley, and brought to MC Hammer's attention that Angie was a vocalist. Hammer is also the one credited with giving Boyd her stage name B Angie B, when Hammer said \"just be Angie\" one day.\nB Angie B sang on \"Pump It Up (Here's the News)\" from MC Hammer's Let's Get It Started album (the version re-released on Capitol Records in 1988), and she became a backup singer during his concert tours. During one tour, she briefly dated Mike Tyson. Her next opportunity came in 1989 with Hammer's female rap trio Oaktown's 3.5.7. She added her vocals to their rap song \"Juicy Gotcha Krazy\" from the album Wild & Loose, and appeared in the music video with the group. In 1990, she continued to perform background vocals for Hammer during his successful Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em album and tour period.\nIn early 1991, Hammer signed B Angie B to his Capitol-distributed Bust It Records imprint and soon her debut album was released, titled B Angie B. It was co-produced by Hammer and Felton Pilate, a former member of Con Funk Shun. In April 1991, the album debuted at number 11 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. It peaked at number 133 on the Billboard 200. The release of the album was led by the single \"So Much Love\", followed by two covers: \"Sweet Thing\" (originally by Rufus & Chaka Khan) and \"I Don't Want to Lose Your Love\" (originally by The Emotions). The latter was the album's biggest hit, reaching number 54 on the Billboard Hot 100. B Angie B toured with Johnny Gill around the time of the album's release.In July 1991, she began dating Tyson again, while on tour with several Bust It musicians. She would later become a prominent witness in Tyson's 1992 rape trial. She also appeared in the Kid 'n Play farce Class Act and sang on the soundtrack's title track \"Class Act (Work That Body)\", which was also released as a music video. Late in 1991, Boyd left Capitol Records. Boyd released a second album in 1995 on the Bust It label (with an independent distributor). She dropped the first \"B\" from her name, performing as simply Angie B. The album release was preceded by the single \"It's My Life\". Neither the album nor the single charted. Nevertheless, critics identified her as a forerunner of neo soul R&B, which became more prominent over the course of the 1990s and beyond. Alex Henderson of AllMusic noted: \"B Angie B did her part to bring soul music to a hip-hop/urban contemporary generation... She was doing that type of thing before the rise of Mary J. Blige, D'Angelo, Erykah Badu or Jill Scott.\"After 2000, B Angie B (then amicably divorced from James Earley) returned to Mississippi. Boyd had one child, a daughter, with Earley. Her 1991 solo debut B Angie B was reissued in mid-2005 via Capitol Records. It included a bonus DVD, along with previous releases with Oaktown's 3.5.7. In the summer of 2009, she released new music via her Myspace account (myspace.com/bangiebmusic), including a remake of \"Ring My Bell\". In 2013, B Angie B signed a recording contract with Monarchy Records, a division of the Spectra Music Group. Her most recent album \"Stronger Than Ever\" was released on April 22, 2013. This project is a collaboration with Italian DJs Max Mazzeo and Dirty Old Boyz.\n\n\n== References ==\n",

His father, a pastor, disapproved of his son's choices, until he realized B.o.B was using music as a form of therapy and a creative outlet. B.o.B later reflected on his experience, saying, \"They've always supported me. They got my first keyboard to make beats on and they helped me out getting equipment here and there. But it was kind of hard for them to really understand what I was really trying to accomplish.\" B.o.B attended Columbia High School in Decatur, Georgia, where he played the trumpet in the school band, until he landed a record deal and decided to drop out of school in the ninth grade.\nIn 2002, after meeting his mentor and co-manager B-Rich at the age of 14, B.o.B sold his first beat to former Slip-n-Slide recording artist Citti, for the song \"I'm the Cookie Man\". B.o.B felt he had established a substantial career. \"I went and blew all of my money on fast stuff like a chain and ballin'. Soon I was broke again, but I learned two important things from it; make sure I save my money and that I was hooked on music.

            "early_life": "Baack was born in Berkeley, California, which remains his home today. He graduated in 1964 from the University of California, Berkeley, with a major in history. At Berkeley, his advisor was Raymond J. Sontag, the well-known scholar in European diplomatic history, and was on the varsity track team running under the legendary Olympic coach Brutus Hamilton. He was later asked to edit a collection of Hamilton's writings and letters.Baack was an officer in the United States Navy from 1964 to 1969, and had three deployments to Vietnam during the Vietnam War. He subsequently entered graduate school in history at Stanford University. There he was a student of Peter Paret, the distinguished Europeanist, who greatly influenced his approach to the study of history. He received his PhD in 1973. His academic career began at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, where he was promoted and tenured, and became Vice Chair of the History Department. He also served as Head of the Area Studies Program in International Affairs and Business, Chairman of the University Libraries Committee and a member of the University Research Council. While at Nebraska, he was also a guest professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and was selected by the National Science Foundation as the U.S. Antarctic Fellow for 1979\u201380. During that year he participated in American research activities in Antarctica including the exploration of the Ellsworth Mountains. At Nebraska his major published research studies examined social and agricultural change in 18th-century Denmark, and Prussia's German and European policies and notions of German nationhood during the first third of the 19th century. The latter work has been called \"a remarkable scholarly achievement\" (Felix Gilbert), and the reviewer in the English Historical Review concluded \"Baack's outstanding study of Pre-March Prussia cannot be ignored by anyone interested in modern German history.\" (William Carr).After his work in Antarctica, he returned to the San Francisco Bay Area and, beginning a business career, accepted a position as the director of education at the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), at that time the nation's largest gas and electric utility. He subsequently held a number of executive positions at PG&E, including head of the community and governmental relations departments and vice president for corporate planning. While at PG&E, he continued to be involved academically, normally teaching a seminar each semester at either San Francisco State University or the University of California, Berkeley.During that period he was also active as a civic leader in the San Francisco area. He served as President of the Bay Area Economic Forum, a leadership partnership of governmental, business, university, environmental, community and labor leaders in the region. He was also Chairman of the Bay Area Defense Conversion Task Force charged with the challenge of dealing with the closure of twelve military bases in the region in the wake of the end of the Cold War with the attendant loss of over 250,000 jobs. He was the co-chair of the Bay Area Water Transit Task Force, and was asked to be the chair of the board of directors of the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement Program by the president of the University of California System, a program serving historically under-represented minorities in the California schools and universities. He was also appointed to the California Commission on the Management and Leadership of the Public Schools, the Director's Blue Ribbon Task Force for the California State Park System, the California Economic Policy Working Group of the California State Legislature, and the Regional Planning Committee for the Association of Bay Area Governments. He has served as a director or trustee for a number of organizations whose work focused on services for urban youth, education, economic opportunity for minority communities, and reducing poverty and homelessness, as well as for organizations such as the United Way of the Bay Area and the World Affairs Council of Northern California.In retirement, Baack returned to academic research and was a visiting scholar in the history department at the University of California, Berkeley from 2003 to 2011. His research interests and publications have focused on European scientific exploration in the 18th century.He has been married, since 1964, to Dr. Jane E. Baack, a retired professor of organizational behavior at San Francisco State University.

In 1962 Baas started studying biology at Leiden University. In his first year of biology Baas hated plant systematics as he hardly knew any plants or animals. He preferred plant anatomy and physiology. While studying he was offered a job at the Rijksherbarium, the herbarium of Leiden University, by its director Cornelis Gijsbert Gerrit Jan van Steenis. Baas rejected the offer, having no interest in working in a herbarium. For his final year of studying Baas wished to stay at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Van Steenis agreed to this if Baas took up a course of systematics. Between 1968 and 1969 Baas studied at the Royal Botanic Gardens under Professor C.R. Metcalfe. On his return from the United Kingdom Baas approached Van Steenis and asked to be employed as a wood anatomy expert. In 1969 Baas became an employee of the Rijksherbarium.In 1975 Baas earned his PhD in wood anatomy, with a thesis entitled: \"Comparative anatomy of Ilex, Nemopanthus, Sphenostemon, Phelline, and Oncotheca\".

He learned to create music on early versions of Schism Tracker (a popular clone of Impulse Tracker) and Ableton Live in the early 2000s, both rudimentary tools at the time. It was his brother, Harry Rosenfeld, who introduced him to music composition through Impulse Tracker, commenting that \"even an idiot\" can successfully create music with it. His brother was also known as C818, from which he chose the name C418, claiming that the name is \"really cryptic and doesn't actually mean anything\".\nAfter being introduced to music production by his brother, Rosenfeld started releasing music on Bandcamp after Danny Baranowsky suggested releasing his music on the site.In 2007, Rosenfeld started a blog known as \"Bl\u00f6dsinn am Mittwoch\" (English: \"Silliness on Wednesday\"), where he posted a new song every week. This was around the same time when he became interested in game development and audio, which resulted in him joining the indie game development forum TIGSource, where he became involved with numerous smaller games and game developers (among them, Rosenfeld unofficially released the soundtracks of Zombie Dog in Crazyland and Mubbly Tower on his site and old blog). Later, Rosenfeld started making albums and releasing them on the blog and also Bandcamp, as a hobby.His first release was the 2007 EP BPS, and shortly thereafter, in 2008, he challenged himself to make a studio album as quickly as possible, for fun, prioritizing quantity over quality, The Whatever Director's Cut was released on his blog as BAM #30 and on his Bandcamp, where it was available until it was removed in 2013, due to Rosenfeld's dislike of the album.Also in 2008, Rosenfeld released Mixes, a 25-minute medley containing remixes of songs previously posted on the blog, also were released the EP Sine, and his second studio album Zweitonegoismus, the album expressed his feelings working in an assembly line factory. Rosenfeld showed the album to his co-worker prior to releasing it, in which they asked \"why the hell [he was] still working there\".\nOn 16 June 2021, Rosenfeld announced on Twitter that his album from 11 years prior, Life Changing Moments Seem Minor in Pictures would be remastered and released onto major streaming platforms.

            "early_life": "Flavio Caballero grew up with two childhood dreams: he wanted to become both a psychologist and an actor. When he was in high school, he became more interested in psychology, and he was an above average student, becoming able to attend college, where he pursued a career as a psychologist.\nEventually, he began losing interest in that career, focusing instead on becoming an actor. Caballero began to study acting at the Instituto de Arte Dramatico Juana Sujo.\nCaballero established himself in Caracas, Venezuela, where he kept studying acting, at the Instituto Nacional de Teatro de Caracas. He also studied acting in the United States and Brazil.\nIn 1971, Caballero made his film debut, acting in an Italian-Spaniard-French production, Il Corsaro Nero (\"Black Pirate\"). Caballero proceeded to act in more than seven theatre plays, and, in 1979, he appeared on Venezuelan screens for the first time, in a film named El Reba\u00f1o de los Angeles (\"Angel's Herd\"). In 1982, Flavio made his telenovela debut, acting in La Se\u00f1orita Perdomo (\"Ms. Perdomo\"). That soap opera was the first of seventeen soap operas produced by Radio Caracas Television that Caballero would participate in, including 1983's Leonela, 1987's La Intrusa (\"The Intruder\") and Mi Amada Beatriz (\"My Beloved Beatriz\"), 1988's Aventurera (\"Adventurer\"), and 2002's Mi Gorda Bella (\"My Beautiful Fat Girl\").\nPerhaps Caballero's most important career year was 1989, when he reached international fame starring in Amanda Sabater alongside Maricarmen Regueiro. Caballero played Ivan Moros in the soap opera. Amanda Sabater was an heiress whose father was Diego Sabater. However, and unknown to the two main characters in the soap opera, Diego was really Ivan's father and not Amanda's. This soap opera reached high ratings in many countries, including Mexico, Puerto Rico and (among Hispanics) in the United States.\nCaballero is currently under contract with RCN Television of Colombia.\n",

He would not stand up for reelection in the 2007 municipal election. For several years Caballero held important political differences with his uncle Abel (Mayor of Vigo since 2007), although according to Caballero they reportedly did not transcend into the personal sphere. A renowned sanchista, Caballero won the PSG-PSOE vote to determine the Secretary-General of the organization in October 2017 running under a grassroots candidate profile. His bid faced the opposition of the apparatus, including Abel Caballero.He was included in the 5th slot of the PSdG-PSOE list in Pontevedra for the 2016 Galician regional election, but he failed to be elected. He was sworn in as member of the Parliament of Galicia on 31 July 2019, covering a vacant seat.\n\n\n== References ==\n",

Rather than become a professional boxer, he decided to become a rap music MC. He attended Forest Brook High School but in 1986, two months prior to his scheduled graduation, he was expelled for fighting. He never returned to school.\nHis reputation reached J Prince, founder of Rap-A-Lot Records. At the time Prince was looking to revamp the Geto Boys and knew that Willie D would be a key factor in the group's success. Once Willie D was on board, Scarface was added to complete the group.Considered the classic line up, Willie D, Scarface, and Bushwick Bill first emerged as the Geto Boys in 1989 with their gold record, Grip It! On That Other Level. The record contained the songs \"Gangster of Love,\" \"Do It Like a G.O.,\" \"Size Ain't Shit,\" and \"Read These Nikes,\" all penned by Willie D. Willie went on to record a string of critical and commercially successful solo and group albums including the Geto Boys' \"We Can't Be Stopped\" (platinum), which featured the single \"Mind Playing Tricks on Me,\" co-written by Willie D.\nIn 2009, Willie D was featured on a song called \"Down South Hustlaz\", along with Young Buck, Trae, Bun B, and Rick Ross.\nHe was featured on a track on Mike E. Clark's Extra Pop Emporium along with Insane Clown Posse and Twiztid called Scrubstitute Teachers. In April 2012, he released \"Hoodiez\" featuring Scarface, D-Boi and Propain.  The song quickly went viral and became an internet hit.  It is a tribute to slain teenager Trayvon Martin who was shot by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman.\nWillie D's mother, Marvelous Dennis, who later became Marvelous Basey through marriage (died February 14, 1994), was born in Houston, Texas. She named him after his maternal grandfather, Willie Dennis. She was a cafeteria cook for the Houston Independent School District (HISD) for several years. His father, Alfred Deboest (died May 17, 1998), was from Lake Charles, Louisiana. He was a carpenter and construction worker by trade.\nWillie D was raised by his mother in Houston after his parents separated when he was four-years old. He has stated in interviews that both his parents were alcoholics and that his mother was physically and verbally abusive. Although he rarely saw his dad while growing up, when it was discovered that his father had lung cancer, Willie D took him in to live with him before he succumbed to the disease. Furthermore, despite a troubled relationship with his mother, in 1991 he took his first large paycheck from his music royalties and purchased a four-bedroom house for her while he was still living in an apartment.\nOn September 3, 1994, he married Bridget Bonier, who is a mechanical engineer, in a private ceremony on a yacht in Clear Lake City, Texas.

            "early_life": "Keith McGuffey was born in Danville, Kentucky, to Gertrude Adams McGuffey, a bakery worker, and a taxi driver father. He is the youngest of four older siblings, all sisters, who named him after Keith Partridge of the TV series The Partridge Family. As a kid, he was known for his break-dancing skills and started writing songs when he was only nine years old. His musical influences include L.L. Cool J, New Edition, and old-school R&B when he was younger. His first concert was by Van Halen and even met his best friend Kevin Richardson when he was 12 in 1984 at Cathedral Domain Camp, a church-owned youth camp his father ran. They both played piano and wrote their first songs together, some of which were eventually used for the Backstreet Boys' first demos. After graduating high school, he attended the University of Kentucky for two years, then joined the U.S. Navy and was stationed in Little Creek, VA. After serving in the U.S. Navy, he went back to college and graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration/Management.\nMcGuffey started working as the manager of a TCBY store before he got his record deal after Kevin invited him down to Orlando for a visit. When he got down there, he auditioned for Transcontinental Records and got a record deal. While perfecting his act, Keith worked and toured Europe for the Backstreet Boys in 1995 as a bodyguard and worked as a recording artist in the 1990s under his stage name Trey D. As Trey D., he opened up for the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC on some of their first tours. He wrote and performed all of his own songs, including his singles, which were very successful in Europe and Asia. He even wrote AJ's rap on the band's hit single Get Down (You're the One for Me) and Get Wild for Aaron Carter. He once lived in Germany and considers it his second home.\nAfter touring the world and the US as an opening act for both the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, McGuffey decided to stop being an entertainer and become a player behind the scenes. He created two songs that the Backstreet Boys recorded and released on their album Black & Blue: \"More Than That\" and \"Shining Star\".  He has a joint venture with Sony/ATV in New York that allows him to develop the careers of aspiring songwriters (Shakertown Music Publishing) and is also a founding partner in Avenue 3 Music, a production company that prepares artists for recording deals. McGuffey is currently writing and producing songs for various artists, as well as recording and developing local talent in Louisville.McGuffey and his longtime friend, Kevin Richardson, wanted to give back to their home state and surrounding areas and provide aspiring artists, musicians, songwriters, producers and engineers the foundation and necessary tools that are essential to success in the music industry. This dream led them to create The Music Workshop, a comprehensive company that would educate and guide aspiring musical artists through workshops, personal consulting, and professional demo recording.\nMcGuffey has been married to Julia McGuffey, an IP attorney, since December 30, 2001. The couple have two children.\n",

Both he and Simon Dominic announced they would pursue solo careers. Shortly after leaving the label, E Sens released a song called \"You Can't Control Me,\" which attacked the label and one of its founders, Gaeko of the hip hop group Dynamic Duo. The song led to an outbreak of diss tracks in the Korean hip hop community, with Swings, Gaeko, and Simon Dominic all weighing in on their own response songs by the end of the summer.In 2014, E Sens joined the agency Beasts and Natives Alike and released \"I'm Good,\" his first solo single following Supreme Team's break up. Soon after, he starred in his own internet reality show, also called I'm Good.E Sens was arrested for marijuana use for a third time in April 2015, violating his probation period after previously being arrested in 2012.

He grew up with his siblings raised by a divorced mother who worked three jobs, and he became interested in hip hop after hearing \"Rapper's Delight\" by the Sugarhill Gang. Beginning in fourth grade, Stevens played the snare and bass drum. He graduated from James J. Hogan High School in Vallejo in 1985. Stevens played baseball in high school, recorded music with his siblings, and sold their recordings from the back of a car. After high school, Stevens enrolled at Grambling State University in 1986 with his cousin Brandt Jones and attended the school for one year.\nAlong with former NFL player Chester McGlockton, E-40 opened a Fatburger franchise in Pleasant Hill, California, which has now been shut down. E-40 has promoted a forthcoming publication, E-40's Book of Slang, since 1998, but as of 2013 the volume has not yet been released. He is also a spokesperson for Landy Cognac, and he opened the now-defunct Ambassador's Lounge, a nightclub in Downtown San Jose. On November 16, 2007 it was announced that Stevens signed a franchise agreement with Wingstop Restaurants, Inc. and will open one in Southampton shopping center located in Benicia, California. \"I was introduced to Wingstop in Dallas and as soon as I tasted the wings I was hooked. I love the food,\" said Stevens. \"I chose to open in the Bay Area because this is the soil where I was born and raised, and I still live here to this day. People here are going to love these things.\"In late 2007, E-40 announced a new line of energy drinks called \"40 Water.\" He also has a number of other ventures in the beverage industry, including the wine industry, where he has released three wines including a red blend called \"Function,\" a moscato and high-alcohol fortified wine called \"Mangoscato.\" The wines are branded using the rapper's real name, Earl Stevens.

            "early_life": "E J-yong (his preferred stylized, phonetic spelling; more conventionally romanized as Lee Jae-yong) was born in Daejeon, South Chungcheong Province in 1966. He studied Turkish at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. After graduating from university, he went backpacking around the world in the late 1980s and fell in love with cinema. E said, \"I saw Who Framed Roger Rabbit in Germany, Au revoir les enfants in London, and Barry Lyndon and Pelle the Conqueror in Australia. After I came home, I had to choose a job and movies were the only thing I was interested in. I couldn't imagine wearing a suit and working in a bank.\" E entered the Korean Academy of Film Arts in 1990 and studied filmmaking.\nHe first became known for his 19-minute short film, Homo Videocus (1990) which he co-directed with Daniel H. Byun (Byun Hyuk), and which won the Prix Recherche (Research Prize) and Prix de la Jeunesse (Youth Jury Prize) at the Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival, and the Best Short Narrative award at the 1992 San Francisco International Film Festival. E went on to make other short films such as My Mother's Summer and Time in the Mirror. In 1994 his documentary project, The Story of a City, was stopped in mid-production due to problems with the production company.Finally breaking his long silence in 1998, he presented his feature film debut An Affair, about a woman who starts an affair with her sister's fiance. It won great acclaim both from audiences and critics for E's minimalist, sophisticated sense of directing. The film, which resurrected the career of actress Lee Mi-sook, was presented at the third Pusan International Film Festival, and went on to become the seventh highest-grossing Korean film of the year. An Affair won the Grand Prize at the 1999 Fukuoka Asian Film Festival, as well as the Asian Cinema Kaleidoscope Prize at the Newport Beach Film Festival, and the Critics Prize and Best Artistic, Technical, or Creative Contribution at the Verona Film Festival.E's second feature, Asako in Ruby Shoes in 2000, is one of the first instances of a Korean-Japanese co-production that utilized cast and crew members in both countries on more or less equal terms. Using a Korean crew for the scenes set in Seoul, and a Japanese crew for the shooting in Japan, the film starred Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist (he was also the lead actor of An Affair).  Although not a commercial hit, the film played at several festivals, drawing notice among academics for its portrayal of the interplay between Japanese, Chinese and Korean cultures and receiving widely divergent critical assessments.Then in the fall of 2003, E presented his costume drama Untold Scandal, based on the French novel Les Liaisons dangereuses but set in 18th-century Korea. An unexpected smash hit, it set a new record for the biggest opening weekend for a Korean film and went on to sell over three million tickets. The film also marked the first major film role of TV actor Bae Yong-joon, who would go on to become a popular sensation in Japan in 2004. Staying true to the spirit of the original novel while giving it an entirely new aesthetic, E kept a familiar story interesting with unexpected juxtapositions (for example, a mix of classical European and Korean music in the soundtrack), visual elegance, and efficient storytelling. The film won several awards at the 2004 Verona Film Festival and Shanghai International Film Festival, including Best Director for E.E cast Jo Hyun-jae and Lee So-yeon (who played supporting roles in Untold Scandal) in his short titled Joy of Love, which was released online in late 2004.Given his demonstrated flair for scandalous topics and his new-generation attitude towards moral issues, for his next film E adapted the controversial webcomic Dasepo Girls, which revolved around a high school where the students are sex addicts, the teachers are perverts, and virtually nothing was forbidden. His 2006 film Dasepo Naughty Girls was a campy and playful musical comedy, with a candy-colored palette and mildly racy content. Though praised for the diversity of its characters and their preferences, it grossed US$3.8 million, which for Korean films of average budget is considered a disappointing performance.E's next project Homecoming was selected by the Hong Kong Asia Film Financing Forum (HAF) in 2007. He described it as a \"long look through the past\" in order to understand his own father more deeply, including the Korean War (\"a world colonized and liberated, a war, a country divided, the loss of his hometown, and a family separated\"), and the death of E's mother.In 2009, E gathered an ensemble cast of six of Korea's top female thespians (Youn Yuh-jung, Lee Mi-sook, Go Hyun-jung, Choi Ji-woo, Kim Min-hee, Kim Ok-bin) for his low-budget, semi-improvisational mockumentary Actresses. Set during a fashion magazine shoot on Christmas Eve, the film depicted the celebrity and humanity of actresses, with the cast all using their real-life names and telling candid stories. It became the third of E's creations to be invited to the Berlin International Film Festival's Panorama section.E, along with fellow directors Kang Hyeong-cheol and Jang Hoon were commissioned by the producers of the Samsung Galaxy Note in 2012 to make three short films for their PPL-frequent-film project Cine Note. The team also included Lee Seung-chul for the music, and noted webtoon artists Sohn Je-ho and Lee Gwang-soo who created the film's animated content.But while shooting his Cine Note short How to Fall in Love in 10 Minutes, E simultaneously decided to expand the idea into an experimental feature about remote directing, i.e. making a movie via mobile devices and the Internet without being on set. The result was Behind the Camera, in which E took the mockumentary genre a surreal step further than Actresses by including himself in the cast. As E makes an unprecedented attempt to direct the film from Los Angeles via Skype, chaotic and unpredictable circumstances arise behind the scenes as the cast and crew become frustrated without a director to guide them on set, blurring the line between fiction and reality. E said it was \"difficult to decide how to classify the film in terms of genre. The feature film seems to be a documentary about the production process of a short film, but it also has dramatic elements similar to a reality show.\"In 2014, E directed and co-wrote My Brilliant Life, a film adaptation of Kim Aeran's novel My Palpitating Life. He cast Kang Dong-won and Song Hye-kyo as young parents of a boy with progeria, a genetic disorder that causes rapid aging. Members of E's crew were trained by Oscar-winning special make-up effects artist Greg Cannom.E next wrote the screenplay of The Bacchus Lady, a film about a female senior citizens who sell sex and soft drinks to male senior citizens; it entered pre-production in 2015.\n",

            "early_life": "John Eacott was born in Reading, Berkshire, United Kingdom. His father Kenneth Eacott was a pianist, arranger and composer. His mother Joy Pocock was a dancer and drummer in the family band, in which John started playing trumpet aged seven.\nIn the mid 1970s the family moved to Hayling Island where a lifelong love for the sea, sailing and navigation took hold. It was here where he was introduced to free jazz, leading him to meet Mark Lockheart. In the 1980s John Eacott got a \u2018Psion Organiser\u2019 and started to experiment with computer programming.\nOn graduating from Sussex University, England, in 1982 BA Music, Eacott's career as a musician started with anarchic jazzers Loose Tubes (trumpet, composer), post-industrial metal bashers Test Dept (trumpet, arranger, composer), Roman Holliday, acid jazz group Vibraphonic, and as a trumpeter with a diverse array of artists including Damon Albarn, Goldie, Stereo MCs, The The, Georgie Fame, Terry Edwards and the Scapegoats. He performed with Loose Tube (30 Years Anniversary concerts),and regularly plays with Sarah-Jane Morris, the hKippers, his own Cranky Trio and other bands.\nSince the 1990s he has composed works for theatre including the worldwide touring production of Gormenghast,'. In 2012 he composed music for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) production of The Taming of the Shrew , in 2014 Turgenev's Fortune\u2019s Fool at the Old Vic, London and most recently Charles Dickens' Great Expectations  in 2016, at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds; all plays directed by  Lucy Bailey.\nFilm scores include the Miramax feature Three Steps to Heaven (1995), Escape to Life with Vanessa Redgrave (2000) and worked as arranger with Dave Stewart and Mick Jagger on the soundtrack of Alfie starring Jude Law (2004).\nIn the autumn of 1998 John Eacott performed his first live generative composition in London, UK. He developed his generative composition in two Sound Art exhibitions at Morley Gallery, London, \u2018Strange Attraction\u2019 in 1999 and \u2018Another Strange Attraction\u2019 in 2000 which featured amongst others the interactive sound designer Dominic Robson and sound sculptor Max Eastley.\nIn 2001 Eacott made a generative music album \u2018Morpheus\u2019 together with Nick Collins, Frederik Oloffson and others using SuperCollider audio programming environment. These compositions formed  part of a number of projects that contributed to his PhD \u2018Contents May Vary: the behaviour and play of generative music artefacts\u2019 (2007) awarded by the University of Westminster.Since the completion of his PhD, Eacott has focused on making accessible live performances using algorithmic composition as part of the organisation Informal.  Floodtide, which premiered at Trinity Buoy Wharf, Docklands in June 2008, is a musical performance generated by tidal flow.  Floodtide works by submerging a sensor into tidal water, the data from which is transformed by custom computer software, into notation read live from computer screens by musicians. Floodtide has been performed numerous times, most notably at Southbank Centre's See Further-Festival of Science and Arts in 2010 and the Mayor's Thames Festival in 2009. A permanent tidal sensor (provided by Nortek) is installed at Trinity Buoy Wharf which gives a constant reading of Thames tidal data on the Floodtide website. Musicians anywhere in the world can play the music generated at any time. Trinity Buoy Wharf is also the home for a Floodtide sound sculpture (2014) by Andrew Baldwin, that continuously plays live local tidal readings. In 2015 John Eacott took the Floodtide project on a five months tour on Jacomina, a 46 ft sailing yacht, performing the piece in ports in Europe and UK with local musicians.\nEacott's work Hour Angle works in a similar way to Floodtide, yet its notation is generated by calculating the movement of the sun.  Hour Angle performances include the summer solstice of 2010 at Royal Observatory Greenwich.He has taught at London College of Communication's and Middlesex University; he worked as Principal Lecturer in Music at University of Westminster  between 1993\u20132011.\n",

Eagar studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he studied modern sciences, before switching to anthropology. During his time at Cambridge, Eagar worked for Varsity newspaper and Image. In 1966, Eagar worked for five months taking photos at a children's hospital in Saigon. Eagar particularly liked the photography in Sports Illustrated.\nDuring the 1963 West Indies series in England, Eagar took a photograph of Wes Hall breaking Colin Cowdrey's arm in the Lord's Test match. This was in spite of the fact that the ground did not permit photography. The first Test match where Eagar was an official photographer was the 1965 match at Headingley between England and New Zealand; John Edrich scored a triple century in the match.After a rise in freelance photographers, Eagar began to cover matches on a more frequent basis, beginning with the 1972 Ashes series in England. In the 1972 Headingley Ashes Test, Eagar had just one over to take a photograph for The Sunday Times to use for the next day's newspaper. During the 1970s, he produced photographs for the Wisden Cricket Monthly and The Cricketer magazines. His best-known photos include Rod Marsh's catch to dismiss Tony Greig in a 1975 Cricket World Cup match at Headingley, England captain Michael Vaughan holding The Ashes urn after England won the 2005 Ashes, and Andrew Strauss' catch in the same series. In interview, Eagar said that his favourite photo was of Gordon Greenidge playing cricket on the beach in Bridgetown, Barbados in 1973, and that his favourite player to photograph was Kim Hughes, due to his improvisation at the crease.In 2005, Eagar held an exhibit of his Test match cricket photography at Lord's. The 300th Test match where Eagar took photos was at Lord's in 2007, and the 2010 Ashes match in Perth was his 100th England-Australia Test match.In early 2011, Eagar announced that he was retiring. He had covered 325 Test matches, including 98 Ashes Tests. He had produced over half a million images. In a post-retirement interview, Eagar reckoned that Richie Benaud and John Woodcock had seen more Test matches than him.

Accepting a Visual Arts Board Grant for study in Europe and United States; she studied at Kala Art Institute, from 1981 to 1982. She completed her Masters of Visual Arts at College of Fine Art, New South Wales in 1990, and an artist residency at the Greene Street Studio, New York, in 1988.\nEager first became known for her paintings of familiar objects such as chairs, tea cups and vases.  Manipulating colour and light, \"her art makes us more responsive to, and even wary of, otherwise benign interiors.\"From 1988 Eager work leaned more and more to abstraction. Her compositions explore links between shapes. For ten years those shapes were triangles, although the shapes are currently multi-sided. The interplay between colour and light recurs in Eager's abstract work. Her 2021 survey of 40 years of drawing articulated these developments.\n",

The group reached the final round of a televised \"World Skiffle Championship\" in 1958, and were offered a residency at the 2 I's Coffee Bar in London.  There, they were signed by impresario Larry Parnes, who took Taylor into his stable of performers, and gave him one of his characteristic stage names, Vince Eager.  After touring and releasing an EP as Vince Eager & the Vagabonds, Clark and Fretwell returned home. Vince Eager and Brian Locking remained in London, Locking performing with Marty Wilde before joining the Shadows.\nIn the years that followed the Parnes era, he toured on the cabaret circuit, and performed in theatre and pantomime. For five years he starred in the West End musical Elvis. In 1986, he moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States, where he worked as a cruise director on American luxury cruise ships.\nNow residing back in the UK, Eager's career has had something of a resurgence. Teaming up with producer and musician Alan Wilson, there have been new recordings some of which have featured Eager's old friends including; Marty Wilde, Albert Lee and Chas Hodges. The resulting album release, titled 788 years of Rock n Roll sold well enough for Wilson's Western Star record label to invite Eager back for another session in 2013. The latest album, Rockabilly Dinosaur was released in 2014. Eager now lives in Nottinghamshire.In 2018, he featured on the track \"Halfway to Paradise\" on the newly released Billy Fury album The Symphonic Sound of Fury.\n",

An early experience of falling from a roof raised his interest in understanding the neural basis of time perception. He attended the Albuquerque Academy for high school. As an undergraduate at Rice University, he majored in British and American literature. He spent his junior year abroad at Oxford University. He graduated from Rice in 1993. He earned his PhD in Neuroscience at Baylor College of Medicine in 1998, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at the Salk Institute.\nEagleman is currently an adjunct professor at Stanford University, after directing a neuroscience research laboratory for 10 years at Baylor College of Medicine.

Eagleman is a Guggenheim Fellow, a Fellow of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, and a council member on the World Economic Forum's Global Agenda Council on Neuroscience & Behavior. He was voted one of Houston's Most Stylish men, and Italy's Style fashion magazine named Eagleman one of the \"Brainiest, Brightest Idea Guys\" and featured him on the cover. He was awarded the Science Educator Award by the Society for Neuroscience. He has spun off several companies from his research, including BrainCheck, which helps medical professionals assess and diagnose cognitive impairment and dementia, and Neosensory, which uses sound-to-touch sensory substitution to feed data streams into the brain, as described in his TED talk.Eagleman has been profiled in magazines such as the New Yorker, Texas Monthly, and Texas Observer, on pop-culture television programs such as The Colbert Report and on the scientific program Nova Science Now. Stewart Brand wrote that \"David Eagleman may be the best combination of scientist and fiction-writer alive\". Eagleman founded Deathswitch, an internet based dead man's switch service, in 2007.

            "early_life": "Eagler graduated with a B.A. in 1976 from Fairleigh Dickinson University in Political Science and Russian Area Studies. In 1977 he began working as the Safety Inspector for the New Jersey Highway Authority, serving in that capacity for ten years until he was selected to head the directorship of the Heritage Festivals at the Garden State Arts Center. When the Arts Center was privatized, Mr. Eagler was assigned to the computer area of the Highway Authority where he now works.\nIn 1990, Eagler campaigned for and won a seat on Clifton's City Council. He was subsequently reelected in 1994 and 1998. While serving on the council Eagler became a rising star in the county Democratic Party, and in 1995 was nominated with Harry Lashley to run against incumbent Republican Freeholders Walter Porter and Jack O'Brien. Although Eagler failed to finish in the top two, the Democrats stood him for election the following year with Georgia Scott and the two gained the first two seats in what would eventually become an absolute Democratic majority on the Freeholder Board in 2000. Following the Democrats taking the majority on the Freeholder Board following the 1997 election, Eagler was elected to a one-year term as Freeholder Director. He again was elected to the Director position in 2001.\nIn 2001, Eagler decided to run for state assembly as a Democrat alongside Willis Edwards III. Thanks to redistricting from the 2000 census Clifton, which had for years been linked with several Republican-leaning towns and cities, was paired with many Democratic strongholds in Essex County. Due in large part to that Eagler, Edwards, and State Senator Nia Gill swept the incumbent Republicans out of office. This enabled Eagler, with his seat on the Clifton council and the Passaic County Freeholder Board, to hold three offices simultaneously. He did not, however, stand for reelection to the Clifton city council in May of that year, but was reelected in November to a third term as Freeholder.\nEagler stood for re-election with East Orange's Sheila Oliver replacing Edwards on the ticket in 2003. Despite a divided ticket, where Eagler and Oliver ran under a separate Senate candidate, Eagler and Oliver were reelected along with Gill for a second term. He did not run for re-election in 2005 for reasons made unclear (it was not certain whether Eagler decided not to run on his own or if he had been bumped from the ticket in favor of current Assemblyman Thomas Giblin), and combined with his decision not to run for a fourth term as Freeholder Eagler left public office altogether.\nAfter taking some time off, Eagler decided to attempt to regain a seat on the Clifton City Council. In May 2006, he was returned to the council along with three other candidates that ousted four incumbents (including three that had served multiple terms). He has since stood for re-election in 2010 and 2014, retaining his seat both times, and is running for another term in November 2018.\nIn September 2022, Eagler announced his retirement from the Council after his six different full terms there (1994-98/1998-2002; 2006-2010/2014-18/2018-22), along with his term in the General Assembly; that announcement came alongside Mayor James Anzaldi also announcing his retirement from the Council, after his nine consecutive terms as Mayor (1990-2022), with reported \"infighting\" among members of the Council over the direction of the City of Clifton early in the 2020s being their main reasons for suddenly wanting to retire from the Council.\n",

He began playing the guitar at age 12.\nAs a teenager Eaglesmith hopped a freight train to Western Canada and began writing songs and performing.\nEaglesmith founded a band known as the Smokin' Losers. He later formed a group called as both the Flying Squirrels and the Flathead Noodlers, switching the name to represent different styles of music. The Flathead Noodlers play bluegrass, while the Flying Squirrels play more folk and rock. His first self-titled album was released in 1980.Eaglesmith appeared in a 2001 television movie, The Gift.\nA typical Fred Eaglesmith show includes his music set between several lengthy between-song comic monologues by Eaglesmith. Topics in the past have included stories about crossing the U.S.\u2013Canada border, Newfoundlanders, and some friends from an Indian reserve. His fans are known as \"Fredheads\", a nod to deadheads, who followed the Grateful Dead. He is known to tour extensively throughout Canada and the U.S.\nWhen Eaglesmith appears in solo performances, he bills himself as Fred J. Eaglesmith. In addition to his own albums, he frequently collaborated with the late Willie P. Bennett, a former member of Eaglesmith's band, who stepped down after a heart attack in early 2007. Eaglesmith publishes his own records.\nIn 2010, Eaglesmith was featured on the Late Show with David Letterman as the musical guest.

        "Wayne_Eagling": {
            "early_life": "Wayne John Eagling was born in Montreal, Quebec, to Anglophone parents, Edward and Thelma Eagling. He spent much of his childhood and youth in California, where his family had moved. As a boy, he augmented his academic studies by attending classes at the Patricia Ramsey Studio of Dance Arts. There, he developed into a gifted student of classical ballet and, as he matured, was encouraged by his teachers to pursue a career as a professional dancer. In 1965, when he was 15, he was noticed by Michael Somes and Gerd Larsen of the Royal Ballet during the company's tour of the United States and was offered a place at the Royal Ballet School in London. He moved to England in the late 1960s, when \"swinging London,\" the vibrant cultural phenomenon of fashion, popular music, and entertainment, was at its peak. Eagling resisted its allure, however, and remained a devoted student of classical ballet and related arts. A strapping young man, he was invited to join The Royal Ballet in 1969, when he was only 18.\nEagling proved to be a valuable addition to the company. A supple and powerful dancer, he was promoted to soloist in 1972 and to principal dancer in 1975. As the product of \"an eclectic training with a mix of lots of different methods,\"  he was exceptionally versatile. He performed the leading roles of princes, gallants, and swains in the nineteenth-century classics\u2014partnering with dancers including Margot Fonteyn, Jennifer Penney, and Merle Park\u2014but he was best known for his work in the twentieth-century repertory. A favorite of renowned British choreographer Kenneth MacMillan, he created roles in a number of his works, including Elite Syncopations, a suite of ragtime dances, and Gloria, an elegiac work about the futility of war. He danced the role of Crown Prince Rudolf in the New York premiere of MacMillan's Mayerling in April 1983. He also danced in ballets by Frederick Ashton, George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Rudolf Nureyev, among others. He was especially admired as Balanchine's Apollo, as Woyzeck in MacMillan's Different Drummer, and as the Chosen One in Glen Tetley's The Rite of Spring, the first male dancer to undertake that dramatic role. While still active as a principal dancer, Eagling began to take part in choreographic workshops sponsored by the Royal Ballet. His first work for the company was Frankenstein, the Modern Prometheus, made in 1984. Other works soon followed, mounted for his home company and for companies abroad.\nIn 1991, Eagling retired from dancing and took up the post of artistic director of Het Nationale Ballet (Dutch National Ballet) in Amsterdam. As chief choreographer, he created a spate of new works in the following years. In 1996, he collaborated with Toer van Schayk on a new production of The Nutcracker and the Mouse King. Set in Amsterdam around 1810, with skaters on a frozen canal and Saint Nicholas instead of Herr Drosselmeyer, it was an immediate hit with the Dutch public and was later staged by the Finnish National Ballet and the Polish National Ballet. During Eagling's tenure as artistic director, he not only maintained the classical and neoclassical repertory of the Dutch National Ballet but actively commissioned new works by contemporary choreographers such as Ashley Page and David Dawson. After he left his post in Holland in 2003, he worked on the international scene for two years, occasionally staging works for the legendary Italian ballerina Carla Fracci.\nIn December 2005, Eagling was appointed artistic director of the English National Ballet in London, where he continued to invent new stage works. Notable among them were the witty Men Y Men, set for nine male dancers in 2009, and, in 2010, yet another version of The Nutcracker, a perennial favorite. During his seven years with this company, he was warmly appreciated by audiences and was both respected and beloved by his dancers. In 2012, however, he was forced to resign in a controversial dispute with the governing board over drastic cuts to the company budget.\n",

Both parents split up shortly after his birth. Ploof later married Jim Eakins, a Canadian long-distance truck driver, and Dallas subsequently adopted his stepfather's last name. In October 1974, Eakins' family relocated to Peterborough, Ontario. As a youth, he played in the 1980 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Peterborough.\nEakins played 4 seasons in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) for the Peterborough Petes, being named the captain in his final year and also the team's best defenseman that season. Jeff Twohey who was with the Petes for 3 decades called him the best captain the team ever had, saying \"He was a great leader. He was a hard worker, loyal, tough, and never afraid to confront people. He knew how to keep players in line.\"Eakins was drafted 208th overall by the Washington Capitals in the 1985 NHL Entry Draft. He went on to play 120 career NHL games, scoring no goals and 9 assists for 9 points, thus becoming the second Floridian to play in the NHL, but the first to ever record a point. Eakins is the first player \nborn in the state of Florida to play for the Florida Panthers, having played for the club on two separate stints (but was raised primarily in Canada). However, the majority of Eakins career was played in the American Hockey League (AHL) and the International Hockey League (IHL). In those two leagues, Eakins played 882 games, scoring 43 goals and 179 assists for 222 points, whilst playing for 10 different teams. Eakins also won a Calder Cup and a Turner Cup as a member of the Chicago Wolves.\nEakins once made a bet with Cincinnati radio personality Dennis \"Wildman\" Walker of WEBN while a member of the Cincinnati Cyclones that he would not score more than 3 goals in one season. Walker stated that Eakins could shave his head at center ice of the Cincinnati Gardens if he eclipsed that mark. Eakins not only scored six goals, but did it in 30 games. The head shaving took place at center ice, prior to a game in December 1994, against the Long Beach Ice Dogs.\nWhile serving as the captain of the Manitoba Moose in the 2003\u201304, Eakins switched from his number 6 to number 37, in honor of his friend and former Wolves teammate, Dan Snyder, who was killed in a car accident in Atlanta, Georgia. Snyder was a member of the Atlanta Thrashers.\nAfter retiring as a player, Eakins joined the Toronto Maple Leafs organization as an assistant coach for the Toronto Marlies and later the Maple Leafs in 2006.  In 2009, he was given head coaching duties for the Marlies.  While with the Marlies, Eakins was named as one of two head coaches representing the Western Conference for the 2011\u20132012 and 2012\u20132013 seasons AHL All-Star games.\nEakins left the Marlies in the summer of 2013 to become the head coach of the Edmonton Oilers, but was fired from his position after only 18 months on December 15, 2014.  In June 2015, the Anaheim Ducks hired Eakins as the head coach of their AHL-affiliate, the San Diego Gulls.On June 17, 2019, the Anaheim Ducks named Eakins as franchise's 10th head coach.

He is the brother of the now deceased sister Beverly Ann. Robert was educated at St. Bridget's and St. Margret Mary's Elementary Schools, and Barton and Hillpark Secondary Schools (where he met his wife, Irene Brown), Hamilton, Ontario. Robert completed his education at Mohawk College.\nAt age 6, Fab began taking piano lessons, but it wasn't until age 14, when he picked up the guitar, that he first began performing in his band \"The Canadian Museum\" at local high schools and YMCA dances. He spent several years playing in a handful of bands before he became a founding member of \"Buxton Kastle\", his first major group. Signed to RCA Records in 1970 with bandmates Jerry Doucette, Jack Pedler, and David Kastle, the group scored a major hit with the single \"Kagie\", hitting #2 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary chart RPM in 1971.\nWhen Doucette left the group later in 1971, Georgie switched from Hammond CV Organ to guitar. The band then changed labels from RCA to Reprise Records, and then Warner Bros where they again hit the charts with the single \"Red Red The Rocking Horse\", \"Shorty McKenna\", \"Lovin Games\", and \"Love is Life\". It was during this period that Georgie was thrust into the spotlight, appearing on Canadian TV shows such as \"Canadian Bandstand\", \"Musical Friends\", and \"Like Young\", a national musical TV show out of Montreal.\nSoon following the break up of Buxton Kastle, Georgie began his relationship with Skip Prokop, founding member of the Juno award-winning rock orchestra Lighthouse. As well as contributing material to the Lighthouse project, he and Skip co-wrote the #1 Hit \"It Just Occurred To Me\" for A&M Records artist Peter Pringle. The song remained at #1 for the weeks of 2 and 9 May 1981, and earned the boys a BMI award for one of the top ten most played records of the year, and garnered a Gold Record for Pringle. This in turn led to Georgie being approached by Atlantic Records Chairman of the Board, in order to collaborate with Juno Award winner, Kim Mitchell, to write material for his first LP, Akimbo Alogo. The record went platinum and the co-writing efforts produced the Top 40 hit, \"Feel It Burn\", the \"Go For Soda\" B-side entitled \"Caroline\" with Pye Dubois, and the #1 song, \"All We Are.\" Georgie wrote the uncredited lyric hook, \"...you make me feel such a long way away...\"\nBesides being a musician, Georgie is also a record producer and co-founder of the record company \"Race Records\" (), as well as the recording studio \"A cellar full of noise\"\n",

His transfer caused a stir among River Plate supporters, which inspired the musician Javier Montes, who was a fan of the team to compose a song for him called La Banda del Ogro (English: The Band of the Ogre).  In 2010, Fabbiani went to CD Veracruz to play in the Mexican second division, but he failed to impress in preseason training, resulting in Veracruz terminating the contract.

Following her one-year clerkship, in 1977 she accepted a position as a staff attorney for the Alaska Public Defender Agency, working first in appeals, then misdemeanor trials, then felony trials, and then as head of the appellate division.

            "early_life": "Born in Geldrop, Faber grew up in the Strijp neighbourhood in Eindhoven, which also included PSV's home ground, the Philips Stadion. At five, he started playing youth football at local amateur club DBS. Faber's performances led to interest from PSV and EVV, with PSV scout Gerrit van Tilburg having discovered him at DBS. He chose to join PSV at 13. Faber's original position was right winger, but at PSV, he moved to the central defense position under the guidance of former defender and youth coach Huub Stevens.\nFaber played four matches for the Netherlands under-21 team. In February 1998, his good performances with PSV were rewarded with a call-up by coach Guus Hiddink for the senior team trip to the United States. The Netherlands were scheduled to play exhibition matches against the United States and Mexico. After being an unused substitute in the United States match, Faber made a 58th minute appearance in the game against Mexico on 24 February 1998. The match was played in Miami. He replaced Winston Bogarde when the Netherlands were leading 3\u20130. Eventually, the game finished 3\u20132, with Faber causing a penalty in favour of Mexico. Faber was one of the players considered by Hiddink to be selected for the 1998 FIFA World Cup but after he injured himself before the start of the tournament, he was unable to appear.\nIn the summer of 2005, Faber became coach of PSV's reserve team Jong PSV. In the 2005\u201306 season of the Beloften Eredivisie, Faber's team narrowly escaped relegation. But in September 2006, Faber left Jong PSV. He claimed that the team was neglected by PSV and not strengthened as promised. Faber's desire was to remain at the club, but the board did not offer him another position. Faber proceeded to join FC Eindhoven as their assistant manager in December 2006. In October 2007, FC Eindhoven sacked their manager Louis Coolen. Faber stepped up as caretaker manager for two months. He went back to his position as assistant when Gerald Vanenburg was appointed as the new manager in December. Seeking a new challenge, Faber announced in February 2008 he would leave FC Eindhoven at the end of the season. Before his departure, Faber had to become FC Eindhoven's caretaker manager again after Vanenburg resigned in April. He coached the team in the remaining three matches.In 2008, Faber returned to PSV to coach the under-19 squad. He signed a two-year contract. In November 2009, Faber showed interest in becoming the PSV academy director. The other youth coaches favoured Faber as well, but the PSV board decided to appoint Jelle Goes. He decided to leave the club again after the 2009\u201310 season, even though PSV offered him the position of Jong PSV coach. In February 2010, he passed his coaching exam, enabling him to be a manager in the Netherlands. Faber simultaneously agreed on a two-year contract as manager of MVV Maastricht. But in June, he retracted his decision after he was unsure about the club's financial perspectives. MVV accepted Faber's decision. Faber subsequently became the manager of FC Eindhoven after signing a two-year contract. The team performed well in the Eerste Divisie, with a fifth place at the winter break period. In December, Faber was approached by VVV-Venlo to become their manager, but he rejected the offer.In February 2011, Faber was appointed as assistant manager of Bert van Marwijk at the Netherlands national team. After Faber accepted the national team job, his performances with FC Eindhoven went downhill. With four points from the following eleven matches, FC Eindhoven missed out on a play-off spot. In the 2011\u201312 season, the FC Eindhoven performances were again above expectations. The team were third in the Eerste Divisie at the time Faber left the club. In March 2012, Faber returned to PSV as assistant manager after Fred Rutten was sacked as manager. Phillip Cocu was chosen as caretaker. Unlike Cocu, Faber's role was permanent after agreeing on a two-and-a-half-year contract. Faber was present at UEFA Euro 2012 when the Dutch team were knocked out in the group stage. After Van Marwijk resigned in the wake of the elimination, Faber also quit to fully focus on his job at PSV. Despite receiving several managing position offers in 2013, Faber signed a new two-year contract and continued to work as assistant manager after the appointment of Cocu as PSV manager. After 3 seasons as PSV assistant, in which Faber briefly was interim manager due to Phillip Cocu having an emergency surgery, Faber left to manage newly promoted NEC Nijmegen, where he remained for a season and impressing many clubs by leading the nijmegen side to a top half finish in the league, and proving wrong many pundits alike who believed based on Fabers previous record with PSV in the latter stages of the 2013\u201314 season that he wouldn't succeed at NEC. His performances caught the eye of FC Groningen, who appointed him manager in pre-season of the 2016\u201317 season. Faber remained in Groningen for 2 seasons, before being sacked due to inconsistency in results and a failure to qualify for the European play-offs. \nIn June 2018, Faber was appointed head of academy under new manager Mark van Bommel. \nIn November 2019, following the unexpected sacking of Mark van Bommel, Faber was appointed interim manager for the remainder of the 2019\u201320 season, after a decent 6 wins out of 11, the season was nul and voided due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, meaning that PSV automatically qualified for the 2020-21 Europa League 3rd qualifying round based on League position at the time, thus classifying Fabers brief second interim spell as an almost success. Faber left PSV eindhoven in July 202, following the appointment of Roger Schmidt as the new head coach, in a staff rebuild, Faber was also subsequently relieved off his duties as head of academy, despite being the mastermind behind the first team breakthrough's of current stars Donyell Malen and Mohamed Ihattaren.\nHis son, Cas Faber, plays as a midfielder for FC Eindhoven.\n",

            "early_life": "Faber was the youngest daughter of an aspiring aeronautical engineer whose education was halted by the Great Depression. As the only one of her siblings who had an interest in the sciences, she was encouraged by her father to pursue an education in engineering. An initial interest in chemistry evolved to an appreciation for ceramic engineering after Faber recognized its potential in solving many engineering problems. Faber eventually obtained her Bachelor of Science in Ceramic Engineering at the New York State College of Ceramics within Alfred University (1975). She completed her Master of Science in Ceramic Science at Penn State University (1978) where she studied phase separation in glasses with Professor Guy Rindone. After graduating with her MS, she worked for a year as a development engineer for The Carborundum Company in Niagara Falls, New York, on the development of silicon carbide for high performance applications such as engines. Following her year in industry, Faber decided to pursue a Ph.D. in Materials Science at the University of California, Berkeley, which she completed in 1982.\nFaber is married to condensed matter physicist, and current president of the California Institute of Technology, Thomas F. Rosenbaum. They began their careers at the California Institute of Technology in 2013 after Rosenbaum transitioned from his previous position as the John T. Wilson Distinguished Service Professor of Physics and university provost of The University of Chicago. Together, they have two sons, Daniel and Michael. Apart from her research, Faber is a patron of the arts and is especially drawn to theater and art museums.\nFaber and Rosenbaum have established several graduate fellowships and research funding opportunities for students. In 2014, she and Rosenbaum initiated a $100,000 graduate research fellowship at the University of Chicago\u2019s Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, which provides summer research support to students with the aim of increasing representation of women in STEM fields. Together, they created the Guy Rindone Graduate Research Fund (named after Faber's master\u2019s thesis adviser) to help facilitate the choice of a research topic in the student's graduate education. In 2017, she and her husband became the first to contribute to the Gordon and Betty Moore Graduate Fellowship Match at Caltech, and later initiated the Rosenbaum-Faber Family Graduate Fellowship, which aims to provide graduate students with the freedom to pursue their studies and possibly change their research based on unexpected research results.\n",

However, her parents divorced when she was young, and she was raised by her mother, Vannitha. Soon after the divorce, Vannitha entered into a deed poll changing her daughter's name to Diviya G K.Vannitha's elder brother, Stacey Muruthi, is a former captain of the Singapore men's national team. His sons Peter and James Muruthi have also played for that team, as have Anish, Prasheen, and Navin, the three sons of Vannitha's other brother, Sreerangam Paramanantham. Diviya first played cricket when she was about eight years old. Initially, she would play only with her five male cousins, and her uncle Stacey. They would play at the void deck of her grandparents' house in Ang Mo Kio, using biscuit tins as makeshift stumps, and a tennis ball. Playing against boys was challenging, and Diviya's cousins would tease her by saying that she could not play cricket because she was a girl. To improve her cricketing skills, Diviya would watch cricket matches on television, and practise batting and bowling on her own. Her favourite cricketers were Kevin Pietersen, Steve Waugh and Muttiah Muralitharan. She could not play cricket at her school, St. Margaret's Secondary, as it was not available, but took up tennis as a co-curricular activity, and played hockey for the Singapore Cricket Club. Her mother supported her throughout. When she was 18 years old, Diviya was given her first cricket coaching. After Diviya left school, she studied Clinical Science at Charles Sturt University in New South Wales, Australia, a course that has greatly helped her in her cricket career. While living in Australia as a student, she played cricket for the men's team of a club, and hockey and soccer for her university. During her vacations in Singapore, she coached cricket, hockey, and soccer for Asia Pacific Sports Management. She also planned to obtain a post-graduate degree in medicine and become a doctor. However, she was unable, due to financial constraints, to pursue post-graduate studies.\nAs a young player, Diviya took the field in various domestic competitions in Singapore. She played in the boys' U-16 Singapore Cricket Association (SCA) league, in Division Six of the SCA men's league for the national women's team, and in Division Five of that league for the Singapore Cricket Club (SCC).She also played men's club cricket in Australia, with Waratahs in Darwin in 2008, and with Cavaliers in Orange, New South Wales, in 2011.In August 2013, she became the first woman to play in Division Two of the SCA men's league. In her debut match at that level, for SCC Cougars against Marina 1, she took 4\u201324 in eight overs, was named player of the match, and earned praise from the captains of both teams. SCC Cougars won the match by six wickets.In early 2014, Diviya had a 33-day stint playing for one of the top three South African domestic women's cricket teams, Boland, in the Women's Provincial Programme 50-over tournament. As the team's players were not paid, she was sponsored by well-wishers including Joe Grimberg, former Judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court of Singapore and patron of the SCA, and Skiya Sports. The Boland team was so strong that she did not get many opportunities to bat or bowl, but she was praised by the team's coach and her teammates for her potential and determination.The following year, 2015, Divya played for the HV & CV Quick domestic team in the Netherlands. In both years, she also attempted to raise sponsorship to play domestic cricket in both Sri Lanka and Australia, but was unsuccessful. As of 2019, she was still playing domestic men's league cricket for the SCC.In mid-2019, Diviya played for several teams in the Sunbirds Women's League in Singapore, and in December 2019/January 2020 she took the field for Southern Jaguars in the Malaysian Super Women League.\n",

The three have had an ongoing collaboration dubbed \"G Koop and O-Man\" since then.\nG Koop moved to California in 2002 and formed a jazz band, \"The People's Quintet,\" with drummer Donald \"Duck\" Bailey. Unable to find work for the group, G Koop instead began working with music production software, such as Pro Tools and Reason.He has been called a specialist in \"replaying samples\", in which an original sample is reinterpreted and recreated in the studio. The resulting track is a new interpretation that is no longer under the original's copyright, but it still retains the original's character. Producers can use the new work in their own songs without having to pay the fees required to sample the original track.G Koop first produced for the Bay Area hip-hop group Foreign Legion. The group's MC, Prozack Turner, introduced him to producer Jake One, who in turn employed G Koop as a piano teacher. The two worked together on Jake's 2008 album, White Van Music, with G Koop performing instruments. He also worked on Jake's 2009 collaboration with Freeway, The Stimulus Package. The two also partnered together on Drake's \"Furthest Thing\" for his 2013 Nothing was the Same album. Jake One found the original sample for \"Furthest Thing\" from a 1990s live gospel album that Gene Brown, a record collector, recommended to him. However, the rights owners to the song requested high fees. Instead, Jake One asked G Koop to make an interpolation of the sample to avoid publishing issues. G Koop played all the instruments\u2014guitar, piano, organ, drums, and bass\u2014in his studio. The album's main producer, Noah \"40\" Shebib, recorded the vocals for the track with a choir in Toronto.G Koop's first major placement as producer was Nelly's \"Self Esteem\" featuring Chuck D, which was on Nelly's 2008 gold album Brass Knuckles. He has worked with a number of artists, including Atmosphere, DOOM, Funkadelic, The Game, G Unit, Ice Cube, Pusha T, Rhymesayers, and Rihanna, among others. G Koop also wrote, produced, and played a number of songs with George Clinton on Funkadelic's 2014 First Ya Gotta Shake the Gate. The album, the first for the band in 33 years, provided 33 tracks with a number of artists, including Sly Stone, Soul Clap, and Bootsy Collins. The second single on the album, \"Ain\u2019t that Funkin\u2019 Kinda Hard on You,\" was written and produced by G Koop and George Clinton. Hip Hop producer Ill Tal, in his review, called it \"one of the best songs on the album and the name of George\u2019s new auto-biography. The song is smooth, mellow, and funky with George doing most of the vocal leads.\" Nick DeRiso, in his review of the album for Something Else Reviews, called \"Ain\u2019t that Funkin\u2019 Kinda Hard on You\" the \"perfect reintroduction of George Clinton \u2026 since it begins with a darkly ingratiating embrace rather that the expected turn-this-mother-out groove.\"  DeRiso goes on to call the track the \"standout moment from Funkadelic\u2019s sprawling new comeback effort.\" Other G Koop songs were singled out in reviews as well. Ill Tal wrote of \"You Can\u2019t Unring the Bell,\" that it is \"probably my favorite hip-hop influenced song on the album.\" Ill Tal went on to refer to G Koop (although not by name): \"Whoever made the beat did a great job sampling a break beat for the drums and what sounds like an old horn riff from George\u2019s vaults.\" G Koop's bass playing was also recognized in E.E. Bradman's review for Bass Player, who commended G Koop's bass playing on a number of tracks.With Metro Boomin, G Koop co-produced the song \"Bad and Boujee\" by Migos, featuring Lil Uzi Vert\u2014his first no. 1 hit. The song was released in October 2016, and it rose to no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 2017. The song has gone platinum in the United States. The album the song appeared on, Migos' Culture, debuted at no. 1 on the Billboard 200. The sample pack used on the song was originally sent to Metro Boomin, and was used to make not only Bad and Boujee, but also 21 Savage's \"Ocean Drive.\"G Koop worked with producer Southside of 808 Mafia on DJ Khaled's 2016 \"I Got the Keys,\" featuring Jay Z and Future. I Got the Keys has gone platinum, and rose to no. 30 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is on the album Major Key, produced by Southside and co-produced by G Koop and Jake One as co-producers. The album was released at no. 1 on the Billboard 200, and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rap Album.Since then, he has worked with Ant, one of two members of Atmosphere, on Atmosphere's albums Fishing Blues and Southsiders, and in a collaboration with Brother Ali on the latter's album, \"All the Beauty in this Whole Life.\"G Koop's studio, \"Fuzz Deluxxe,\" is based in Oakland. He also runs the website \"Sample Replay Society,\" which works as a catalog for his work. He collects old instruments, such as the Clavinet and Fender Rhodes, and has several Fender guitars. He is a client of Pulse Recording.\n",

            "early_life": "G-Dragon was born on August 18, 1988, in Seoul, South Korea. G-Dragon began his career at age six as part of the group Little Roo'Ra. Following the release of the group's Christmas album, the group's contract was terminated by their record company, which shocked G-Dragon. Although he vowed to his mother that he \"wouldn't [try to become a singer] again,\" he was scouted by SM Entertainment on a ski trip with his family. He was a trainee under the record label SM Entertainment for five years (from 8\u201313 years old), specializing in dance before he left. During his third grade year, a friend introduced G-Dragon to the American rap group Wu-Tang Clan. Having been influenced by their music, he developed interest in rapping and began taking classes. After attending a summer school hosted by the South Korean hiphop group People Crew which he joined after begging his mom, he was introduced to Lee Hee sung, who was member of another South Korean hip hop group X-teen, who tried to make G-dragon into Korea's Bow Wow. Under People Crew's tutelage, he participated in the release of the Korean hip-hop album Korean hiphop Flex(\ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d \ud799\ud569\ud50c\ub809\uc2a4 2001) in 2001, becoming the youngest Korean rapper at 13 years old. Although he wrote his own lyrics, he admitted that his English was weak and the story behind the lyrics was just another typical \"I'm young, but I'm the best\" story. Additionally, he and future fellow BigBang member Choi Seung-hyun were \"neighborhood friend[s] from middle school\" and would often dance and rap together before G-Dragon moved away. Catching the interest of Sean of the hip-hop duo Jinusean from YG Entertainment, he recommended G-Dragon to Sean's record label's CEO Yang Hyun Suk. After signing a contract with the record label, G-Dragon spent the first year cleaning the studio for the other artists in the record label and fetching water bottles during dance practice.\n\nHe chose the stage name G-Dragon (\"Ji\" is pronounced like \"G\", and Yong is Korean for \"dragon\"). He featured on other artists' albums and even released several singles with Dong under the name \"GDYB.\" After YG Entertainment scrapped the plan and opted for a boy band instead, G-Dragon contacted Choi, who auditioned in. G-Dragon, Dong (who chose the stage name Taeyang), and Choi (who chose the stage name T.O.P), were paired with three other members (Jang Hyun-seung, Daesung, and Seungri).\nThe formation of the group was documented on television, but prior to their official debut, Jang was dropped. The now-quintet's debut was a moderate success, with their first album selling over 100,000 copies, and included G-Dragon's first solo recording, a cover of the American alternative rock group Maroon 5's single \"This Love\". The release of the EP Always in 2007 was a musical departure from their previous materials and saw G-Dragon's increased involvement in its production. Several songs were composed by him, including the lead-single \"Lies\", which became the group's first number one hit. Their following EPs followed its predecessor's footsteps: Hot Issue yielded \"Last Farewell\" while Stand Up spawned \"Day by Day\"; both singles, composed by him, were chart-toppers. Having produced the majority of BigBang's materials, G-Dragon became involved with the production of Taeyang's debut extended play Hot (2008), after which he subsequently recorded a \"Part Two\" to the EP's lead single \"Only Look at Me\".\nG-Dragon enrolled at Kyung Hee University in 2008 to study post-modern music. He later dropped out due to his busy schedule, and instead majored in Leisure Sports Studies at Gukje Cyber University, obtaining a Bachelor's degree in 2013. G-Dragon graduated in 2016 with a Master's degree in content and retail distribution at Sejong University. Plans for a doctoral degree were delayed to accommodate his military enlistment. In 2018, The Gazette Review estimated that G-Dragon's net worth is US$40 million. According to Cosmopolitan Philippines, the rapper is one of the most-followed K-pop idols on Instagram with over 21.2 million followers as of July 2022.G-Dragon began mandatory military service on February 27, 2018. After his basic training at South Korea\u2019s 3rd Infantry 'White Skeleton' Division in Cheorwon, Gangwon Province, he was assigned as a regular soldier. 3,000 VIP BigBang fans awaited G-Dragon's return from his military service at the headquarters of South Korean Army's Ground Operations Command in Yongin, southeast of Seoul. G-Dragon was discharged on October 26, 2019.\n",

He became a member of a local hip-hop group called \"The Bay Boyz\", who had released several songs on their Myspace page.In 2008, he was performing at a college talent show and was nearly booed off, when Matt Bauerschmidt noticed him and signed him as a client to his new music management company The Revels Group that he started with Matt Davis. In 2010, G-Eazy was given an opportunity to open for some well-known artists, most notably Lil Wayne and Snoop Dogg. G-Eazy's mixtapes at this period of time were met with limited success. In August 2011, he released The Endless Summer, with an updated version of the 1961 hit song \"Runaround Sue\", which garnered over four million views via YouTube. The music video was directed by Tyler Yee. The mixtape features guest appearances from Greg Banks, Erika Flowers and Devon Baldwin.

The hip hop production team, The Bomb Squad, had silently gone their separate ways after Fear of a Black Planet (1990) and no new Public Enemy album was imminent. After hearing G-Wiz's music, Chuck D immediately planned to do an EP with G-Wiz being the sole producer. The two had such chemistry, the original eight cuts soon turned into 12 and Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black was born. Apocalypse 91: The Enemy Strikes Black, as of 2007, is Public Enemy's greatest selling album to date, selling close to two million copies, and spawning the hits \"Can't Truss It\" and \"Shut Em Down.\"\nG-Wiz went on to produce for artists such as Janet Jackson, Aerosmith, U2, Busta Rhymes, Rakim, Run\u2013D.M.C., Method Man, Redman, Ludacris, Twista, KRS-One, Bell Biv Devoe, Peter Gabriel, Lisa Stansfield, Aaron Hall, Big Daddy Kane, Anthrax and Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor.In 1992, G-Wiz was introduced to the world of film, where he composed the score for the Paramount Pictures film, Juice, starring Tupac Shakur, as well as producing on the film's certified platinum soundtrack.  Since then, G-Wiz has contributed songs and score to Spike Lee's He Got Game, Bulworth with Warren Beatty, Paramount Pictures Mad City, Fox Television's King of the Hill, and a collaboration with Chuck D to create the main title theme to Fox's Dark Angel starring Jessica Alba.

            "early_life": "Dutton, the son of a banking lawyer, was born in the Society Hill neighborhood of Philadelphia, and began playing guitar at age eight. He wrote his first song by the time he was in the ninth grade and began playing harmonica in a wire rack. Dutton credits Bob Dylan and John Hammond Jr., as well as the then-contemporary \"old school\" hip-hop sounds of Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys, and Philadelphia's own Schoolly D, as influences.\nDutton, who attended high school at the private Germantown Friends School, began playing solo on the streets of Philadelphia. After one year at Skidmore College, Dutton dropped out and relocated to Boston, working as a fundraiser for Peace Action and playing wherever and whenever he could.\nShortly after moving to Boston, Garrett met local producer Tom DeMille (later nicknamed T-Time by Garrett because of Tom's dual love for music and golf). Tom had hung a flyer at local music store 'Daddy's Junky Music' speaking of his desire to combine blues influences (like Muddy Waters, Howling Wolf, Little Walter, etc.) with modern music to create a new sound, which of course is exactly what Garrett was doing. Initially Garrett was focussed on recording early versions of songs like Yea It's That Easy and This Ain't living which combined street influences with classic blues instrumentation. Early renditions were typically Dobro guitar over a classic early 1990s HipHop beat and backed by synth bass and keys played by T-Time. In 1992, Garrett and T-Time both realized that neither of them was particularly good at programming good drum tracks and Garrett began looking for help in that area.\nOne of his few indoor gigs at this time was a Boston bar called The Tam O'Shanter (a Boston institution which was in business until 2018), where he met drummer Jeffrey \"The Houseman\" Clemens in January 1993. Dutton and Clemens began working as a duo, they were joined a few months later by bassist Jim \"Jimi Jazz\" Prescott and became the house band on Mondays at The Plough and Stars in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nIn 1993, T-Time flew to New York to meet with an LA producer with connections to Michael Jackson (arranged through a family friend). T-Time shared some studio and live recordings of Garrett, who had just started going by the moniker G. Love. Later in 93 G. Love and Special Sauce (as the trio was now called) signed a record deal and released their first album in 1994.\nG. Love featured Jack Johnson on his 1999 album Philadelphonic playing an early version of Jack Johnson's \"Rodeo Clowns\" when Jack was an unknown artist. Jack later featured the song on his 2003 album On and On. G. Love met Johnson through a mutual surf buddy who said, \"Hey man, there's this kid you got to meet. He's a big fan and he's got this song called rodeo clowns and I think it's really great and I really think you should hear it.\" After that G Love saw Johnson's effortless style and potential and invited him into the studio to record the now-famous \"Rodeo Clowns\".\n\nGarrett dated Tristan Prettyman and wrote the song \"Beautiful\" with her while they were dating.Known for his live shows, he is often seen touring with Jack Johnson and Citizen Cope. As a producer, Johnson signed G. Love to his record label Brushfire Records. He has made appearances on the records of artists such as Slightly Stoopid and Donavon Frankenreiter, and has toured with Dave Matthews. \nIn 2009, he collaborated with Zap Mama on their album ReCreation, singing on the single \"Drifting\".\nIn 2010, G. Love joined forces with The Avett Brothers who produced and are featured on his album \"Fixin' to Die\". The album was released under the Brushfire label on February 22, 2011.\n",

He scored a career-best seven goals in 28 games in his second full season to help the Steelmen narrowly avoid relegation from the Scottish Premier Division, and subsequently returned to the Eredivisie with FC Utrecht.\nFor the 2001\u201302 campaign, van der Gaag joined Portugal's C.S. Mar\u00edtimo, going on to be one of the Madeira club's most influential players as it consolidated in the Primeira Liga. He netted six times in 2003\u201304, helping the team finish sixth and qualify for the UEFA Cup.\nVan der Gaag retired from football in 2007, having spent one season with Al-Nassr FC in Saudi Arabia.

He returned to management after nearly two years, still in Portugal, signing with Segunda Liga side C.F. Os Belenenses.

At the age of 20, he joined the second team of Ajax, but was never chosen to play in the first team, which at the time boasted players such as Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens in the midfield positions. He was loaned to Belgian First Division side Royal Antwerp playing under Guy Thys with whom he was runner-up in the Belgian top division in 1974 and 1975. During his time with Antwerp, Van Gaal suffered a broken nose in a friendly against K.V. Kortrijk. After four years spent in Belgium, he returned to his homeland and made his Eredivisie debut for Telstar under the guidance of manager, Mircea Petescu, whom he followed to Sparta Rotterdam. He later joined AZ, where he also became assistant coach in 1986. After a short career at AZ, he returned to Ajax to become Leo Beenhakker's assistant. When Beenhakker left in 1991, Van Gaal took over as manager.\nThe youngest of nine brothers and sisters, Van Gaal was brought up as a Catholic. His father, a salesman, died when Van Gaal was 11. At the age of 18, Van Gaal met Fernanda Obbes at a Catholic youth group. They married three years later, and had two daughters, Brenda and Renate. In 1994, Obbes died of liver and pancreatic cancer. Van Gaal was mocked by fans of Ajax's opponents for her illness. In 2008, Van Gaal married his current wife, Truus, with whom he shares a holiday home near Albufeira, Algarve, Portugal.According to The Daily Telegraph, it emerged in 2009 that Van Gaal had lost millions of pounds investing in fraudster Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme.On 3 April 2022, Van Gaal said that he was receiving treatment for prostate cancer.

            "early_life": "Gaarlandt was born in Rotterdam on October 9, 1946, to the son of Hans Gaarlandt and Anna Wilhelmina Gaarlandt Hupkes. He is a grandson of Egbertus Gerrit Gaarlandt, a mayor of Gouda, and Hermina Johanna Maria de Kat. In 1977, he married Fran\u00e7oise Kist, with whom he has a son and a daughter.\nGaarlandt studied theology at the University of Leiden, following which he took up studies in art criticism, completing a thesis on the art theory of the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. An article on Van Geel, published in the journal Raam attracted attention, and he was invited by the de Volkskrant newspaper to write reviews for them.\nIn 1995, Gaarlandt became the Lord of the Manor of Barendrecht, a purely honorary position without any role of governance. The hereditary title belonged to his uncle, after whose death, he purchased it for 10,000 guilders.\nPreviously, Gaarlandt has also been Mayor of Emmen and a Queen's Commissioner in Drente.\nGaarlandt's early career was as a reviewer of theological works for the de Volkskrant and the Vrij Nederland magazine between 1973-1979, following which he was assigned more and more literary criticism. Over time, he began to lose interest in reviewing Dutch literature. He said, \"My frustration with the quality of the Dutch literature increased more and more. My pieces were increasingly acidic and cynical.\" He responded to an advertisement for an editorship at De Haan and started work there in 1977.  One of his early successes was his discovery of the war diaries of Etty Hillesum in 1981. The diaries described Hillesum's experiences at the Westerbork transit camp. He edited several volumes of the diaries. Subsequently, he was an editor for the ten volume Modern Encyclopedia of World Literature. He also began to translate books from German.\nIn 1986, Gaarlandt founded the non-fiction imprint Balans, which later merged with De Bezige Bij. Balans became established following the successful publication of Hillesum's books; another popular work was the newly translated Bible by Nico ter Linden. The publishing house was also instrumental in establishing biography as a popular genre in the Netherlands, with the issue of a series of books on Queen Wilhelmina, Hendrikus Colijn, Henriette Roland Holst, and Herman Gorter.Gaarlandt's first book The Ironic Charter, published in 1975, was a collection of poetry. His first novel, The Figure in the Distance, was published in 1998 under the pseudonym Otto de Kat. The pseudonym derived from a distant relative of Gaarlandt's, the painter Otto B. de Kat. His second novel, Man on the Move came out in 2002, while his third, Julia was published in 2008. His 2012 novel News from Berlin was made into a film by Ben Verbong based on a screenplay by Toenke Berkelbach.\nTranslations of Gaarlandt's books have appeared in German, French, Italian and English.\n",

After graduating in 1956 he studied law and economics at the Free University of Amsterdam, receiving his Master of Law, and Doctorandus in Economy in 1963 cum laude. In the last four years of his study he taught Civil Law, Commercial Law and Political Economics. Following graduation he became a fellow at the Social Faculty of the Free University, and wrote his dissertation in Economics. During this period he taught macro- and micro-economic theory. In 1966 he received his Ph.D. in Economics for his dissertation \"Theory of competition policy\".\nIn 1967 De Gaay Fortman left Amsterdam to become a senior lector at the University of Zambia in Lusaka, where he was head of the Economic faculty. Here he taught Economics of Rural Development, and Theory of the Economic Order. In 1968 he was appointed Chairman of the Agricultural Prices and Marketing Committee, an advisory Body of the Zambian government. He wrote two books about his residence in Zambia: \"After Mulunguhsi, the economics of Zambian Humanism\" in 1967 and \"The Third World in Movement, a message from Zambia\" in 1972.\nWhile in Zambia De Gaay Fortman kept close tabs on the developments in Dutch politics. De Gaay Fortman was a member of the Christian-democratic Anti-Revolutionary Party. In 1970 he joined a group of so-called \"spijtstemmers\" (English: \"the Sorry Voters\") or Americain Group (after restaurant Americain, where the group regularly met). The group regretted that their party, ARP, joined a coalition with the liberal VVD instead of the social-democratic Partij van de Arbeid. In 1967 he edited the book \"Christian-Radical\", in which a new leftwing Christian faith was articulated. In 1970 he left the ARP to join the PPR, a Christian-radical party set up by former members of the KVP, who also regretted the Christian-democratic/liberal coalition.\nIn 1971 De Gaay Fortman returned to the Netherlands from Zambia for the election campaign of the PPR. He was one of the two top candidates of the party. In the elections the party got two seats in the House of Representatives, one of which was to be occupied by De Gaay-Fortman. During his period as member of the House of Representatives, he was Professor Extraordinary of Economic Development at the Institute of Social Studies in the Hague. After the election he became Shadow Minister for International Development in Den Uyl's Shadow cabinet. \nHe led the party in the 1972 elections, in which the PPR more than tripled its seats to seven. De Gaay Fortman became the leader of the parliamentary party. Between 1973 and 1975 he was vice-chair of the Defence Committee of the House of Representatives.\nHe seemed an atypical PPR-member, well-educated, upperclass, and with his affected speech. De Gaay however was very popular under young people. In parliament he showed a keen interest in development cooperation.\nBefore 1977 elections the younger Ria Beckers succeeded De Gaay Fortman. De Gaay Fortman became a member of the Senate. He kept this position until 1991. During this entire period he was the party's leader in the Senate. After 1981 however his party was a one man's party. In 1989 his party, the PPR merged with the PSP, CPN and the EVP to become GroenLinks. De Gaay Fortman remained senator for this party.\nDuring this period De Gaay Fortman returned to his passion, science. He was professor of Political Economy at the Institute for Social Studies between 1977 and 2002. He also held many positions in the World of Development Cooperation: most importantly he was president of NOVIB, the Dutch branch of Oxfam, between 1977 and 1984. \nIn 1990 he gave up his seat in the House of Representatives to become delegate for the Reformed Church at the Assembly of the World Council of Churches in Canberra. In 1990 he also founded Economists for Peace, with the late Jan Tinbergen.\nAfter 1991 Bas de Gaay Fortman has held numerous research positions: from 1991 to 1993 he was the director of research for the Institute for Social Studies. Here he taught Political Economy of Jurisprudence, Transition and Development. In 1992 he served as the chair of the Joint Steering Committee of the Netherlands Israeli Palestinian Research Programme (NIRP). From 1992 to 1998 he was a researcher in both the Research School for Development Studies (CERES) and the Netherlands Research School on Human Rights. From 1992 to 1993 he was the chair of the Directorate of the CERES School of Excellence in which six Dutch universities participated. Since 2000 he has been the chair of the Working Programme Formation and Disintegration of States of CERES.\nDe Gaay Fortman also served as correspondent in the Netherlands for several development programs, such as the United Nations Development Program and the European Commission's.\nIn 2002 he became professor of Political Economy of Human Rights at the University of Utrecht. He is the only chair in Political Economy of Human Rights in the world. Until 2005, he taught his trademark class \"Political Economy of Human Rights\", which was part of the Master in Conflict Studies at University of Utrecht. In this class, the majority of the readings used are his own unpublished works. In 2002 he also became a member of the permanent committee for Development Cooperation of the Advisory Council for International Questions of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Since 2003 he has been the vice-president of the Prins Claus Chair of the University of Utrecht and the ISS. From 2003 to 2004 he was the Msgr Willy Onclin Professor of Comparative Canon Law at the Catholic University of Louvain.\nHis research interests focus on the political economy of law, human rights and jurisprudence and political economy of conflict and collective violence.\nDe Gaay Fortman has written and edited many books on Development Cooperation and many other subjects including: \"Help we're developed\" in 1978, \"The Art of Ivory turning\" in 1979, \"New Progress\" in 1984, \"The Small path between Power and Morale\" in 1989, \"Internal Conflicts, Security and Development\" in 1997, \"God and Goods.

            "early_life": "Meschac Gaba was born in Cotonou, Benin, in 1961. He had drifted from his training as a painter until a bag of decommissioned money cut into confetti led him to make paintings with the material. Gaba became known for his installations of everyday objects that whimsically juxtapose African and Western cultural identities and commerce.He held a residency at the Amsterdam Rijksakademie in 1996 for two years. In the absence of opportunities to display his work in the city, he set out over the next five years to make his own museum. This piece became his seminal The Museum of Contemporary African Art 1997\u20132002, which consists of 12 rooms (some based on museum function and others personal) filled with objects made by Gaba. Throughout the exhibition ran a vein of confessional narrative about the artist's art travails between Africa and Europe. The wedding room, which he made while in love, holds mementos as museum artifacts from Gaba's wedding to the Dutch curator Alexandra van Dongen in 2000 at the Amsterdam Stedelijk Museum. The Library room holds art books and tells of Gaba's childhood. The games room showed sliding puzzle tables that form African national flags. It had its own gift shop and caf\u00e9. The exhibited Museum had couches for reading, a piano for playing, and featured objects reflecting Africa's polycultural character, including Ghanaian money featuring the face of Picasso, a Swiss bank mimicking an African street market, and gilded ceramic chicken legs.The Museum exhibited widely. The work was first displayed in part in 2002 at Documenta 11. Gaba received a Rotterdam space in which he could live and store the work. When his son requested a more normal house, Gaba sold and gifted most of the work to the Tate Modern, save for his Library, which Gaba returned to his hometown. Around 2013, Gaba lived half the year in his hometown of Cotonou and the other half in Rotterdam with his wife and son. The Tate Modern displayed the work as a whole in 2013 as part of the Tate's two-year program of African-focused exhibitions. The wedding room enchanted the British art critic Jonathan Jones, who described the Museum as autobiographical, novelistic, protest showing \"the strength of modern African art\". For instance, the Art and Religion room showed \"classic\" African ceremonial sculpture alongside kitschy Buddhist and Christian objects, as if to group the types together as poor representations of their respective cultures. Gaba saw the work as correcting lacks of art education in Africa and African art representation outside the continent.In-between finishing the Museum and its Tate exhibition, Gaba presented at the 2003 Venice Biennale and held his first solo show in the United States at the Studio Museum in Harlem, \"Tresses\", a series of architectural models of New York City and Benin landmarks made from artificial braided hair extensions. The accessory, popularized by African-American pop stars based on West African culture, was repatriated to Africa. Gaba worked with a Beninese hair braider to make the sculptures from his photographs. Holland Cotter wrote in The New York Times that the works were \"delightful\" and recognizable without becoming caricatures.Gaba held his first solo gallery show, \"Exchange Market\", in New York in 2014. On the ground floor, 10 sculptures of unvarnished wood tables each with a wire umbrella stand, from which African banknotes hung. Each table was associated with a type of commodity: cotton, cocoa, diamonds. Along the walls hung bank-shaped works made of wood, plexiglass, and decommissioned money. Upstairs, reminiscent of the games room of Gaba's museum, were four foosball tables and small souvenir sculptures such as hand-painted cricket bats and a miniature billiards table.Artsy selected Gaba's work as a highlight of the 2014 1:54 London art fair.\n",

            "early_life": "Donna Rae Gabaccia was born in 1949 and grew up in rural New York State. Her mother's family were immigrants to the United States from Germany and her father's family were Italian immigrants. As the first of her family to attend university, she was interested in her family migrations and began her studies in sociology. After completing a bachelor's degree at Mount Holyoke College, she earned her master's degree in history in 1975 from the University of Michigan. She then went on to complete her PhD at the University of Michigan in 1979 and did post-doctoral studies in Germany at the Free University of Berlin's John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies. While she was studying in Germany, Gabaccia took her first job, as a current events commentator for the German and American Forces Network Radio. She worked with projects with Amerika Haus Berlin and several museums.\nReturning to the United States, after having learned both Italian and German, Gabaccia taught at Mercy College from 1982 to 1991. Her first book, From Sicily to Elizabeth Street: Housing and Social Change among Italian Immigrants, 1880\u20131930 (1984) evaluated working-class, residents on a single street, focusing on class and community among the immigrants living there. Her initial output evaluated migration through the lens of gender and household composition, rather than the conventional focus on privilege, which forces the family unit into an unknown abstraction, and the narrow focus on individualism. By focusing on the family, she was able to evaluate the separate economic contributions of family members and shifting power dynamics between genders. Two of Gabaccia's groundbreaking books, which both integrated women into migration studies and demonstrated the importance of an interdisciplinary approach were Immigrant Women in the United States: A Selectively Annotated Multidisciplinary Bibliography (1989) and Seeking Common Ground: Multidisciplinary Studies of Immigrant Women in the United States (1992). These books laid the foundation for her \"pathbreaking work on gender and migration\", From the Other Side: Women, Gender, and Immigrant Life in the U.S., 1820\u20131990 (1994).In 1990, Gabaccia initiated a world-wide research network, \"Italians Everywhere\" to facilitate migration study for the period 1870 to 1970 of emigration from Italy. By bringing together specialists with global expertise on a variety of locations, the network was able to evaluate the cross-cultural contribution to nation building and identity. Three edited volumes, Italy's Many Diasporas: Elites, Exiles and Workers of the World (2000) with Fraser M. Ottanelli; Women, Gender and Transnational Lives: Italian Workers of the World (2002) with Franca Iacovetta; and Intimacy and Italian Migration: Gender and Domestic Lives in a Mobile World (2011) with Loretta Baldassar have been produced as a result of the interdisciplinary collaboration of the network. Abandoning nation-based analysis of migration, Gabaccia recognized that when people moved, it impacted both the place from which emigrants originated and the place where immigrants resettled. Gabaccia added depth to the understanding of migration, by showing that it was not a single national story; that destinations were not always finite but often immigrants moved back and forth between locations; and that assimilation was much more complex than a one-directional transfer of culture.These works refuted the notion of transnationists, who believed that global migration was a contemporary 20th century phenomena, characterized by the utilization of technology to quickly assimilate but retain ties to their traditional homelands, which created a climate of dual allegiance that would ultimately undermine national socio-political organization. Gabaccia argued that the study of earlier migrations, not only showed that globalization was not a new phenomenon but that it was unclear whether it was either a permanent shift in cultural practices, sustainable over time, or whether it would lead to the demise of the nation-state. She pointed to the development of diaspora populations of earlier times of internationalism and cosmopolitanism, questioning whether transnationalism was an ideological belief held by migrants, or whether it had any permanency based on historical precedent.From 1992 to 2003, Gabaccia was the Charles H. Stone Professor of American History at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, taking the Andrew Mellon Professor of History at the University of Pittsburgh in 2003. Gabaccia left Pennsylvania in 2005 and until 2012, she held the Rudolph J. Vecoli Chair of Immigration History at the University of Minnesota. During the same period, she was the director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota. During this period, she continued steady production on works dedicated to migration patterns. She particularly focused on the history of women migrants and statistical analysis to bring deeper understanding to the gendered experiences of the past, including changing sexual standards. Her work also evaluated hierarchies of power and it fluctuations upon the agency among migrating people. She also studied the exchange of culture that is evident in food. Her book We Are What We Eat: Ethnic Food and the Making of Americans, evaluates how the food of migrants became a part of the mainstream American diet.After stepping down from the position as director, Gabaccia remained as a professor at the University of Minnesota for two more years, moving to Toronto in 2014, where she teaches in the history department at University of Toronto Scarborough. In 2013, her book, Foreign Relations: Global Perspectives on American Immigration (2012), was translated and republished in Japanese and won the Immigration and Ethnic History Society's Theodore Saloutos Prize in 2013. Her book, Gender and International Migration: From the Slavery Era to the Global Age (2015), written with Katharine Donato, was shortlisted for the American Sociological Association's Thomas and Znaniecki Book Award, winning honorable mention in 2016. In addition to her academic work, throughout her career Gabaccia has worked as a consultant and collaborator with groups of public school teachers, local and national museums, and historical societies to develop a collaborative understanding of knowledge and interpretations of the past. Among those, organizations were the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience, the Levine Museum of the New South, the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, the National Endowment for the Humanities, National Public Radio, the United States Department of Labor and the Ward Museum of Toronto.\n",

After the military coup, which overthrew President of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia in January 1992, Gabashvili joined the State Council of Georgia, an interim body, which relegated its rights to the newly elected parliament in October 1992. Gabashvili held a seat in this new legislature for only two months as he was moved to the post of Ministry of Education in December 1992. Georgia's Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze made him Mayor of Tbilisi from February to October 1993.With the appointment as an ambassador to Germany later in 1993, Gabashvili's decade-long diplomatic career in Berlin began. In 2001, he simultaneously assumed the position of ambassador to Poland. After the November 2003 Rose Revolution, which toppled Eduard Shevardnadze and brought the young reformer Mikheil Saakashvili to power, Gabashvili resumed his political career in Georgia. Closely allied with Saakashvili, he was elected to the Parliament of Georgia on a United National Movement ticket in 2004. For four years of his tenure, Gabashvili chaired the parliamentary Committee for Foreign Relations.

Gabbai served in that capacity until 1998, when he was appointed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to head the economics division of the Prime Minister's Office. After Netanyahu's loss in the May 1999 elections, Gabbi entered the private market, serving as Vice President of Business Development and International Relations at Bezeq International under CEO Uri Yogev from 1999 to 2001.\nIn 2002 he returned to public service and was appointed Director of the Government Companies Authority and served there until 2007, under Prime Ministers Ariel Sharon, Ehud Olmert and Benjamin Netanyahu. This period was characterized by vigorous privatization of state companies, including El Al, Bezeq, Israel's Oil Refineries and Zim, selling shares in a total value of 14b NIS in an unprecedented privatization spree. Other changes he instituted included the split-off of Israel Railways from the Ports and Railways Authority and its transformation into a government company, as well as making the Postal Authority and the Government Department of Public Works an auxiliary unit of government companies.\nAfter leaving the Government Companies Authority, Gabbai was appointed director of the Israeli branch of the investment fund Babcock & Brown. The branch had been negotiating to acquire advanced CHIC Company Canadian holdings Franchisee Route 6 throughout the country. The value of Route 6 was estimated at 300-400 million dollars, but at the end of negotiations no business deal was reached. During this time, the global economic crisis broke out and the value of Australian companies had deteriorated as well as the value of its holdings in Israel. In light of the difficult financial situation of the parent company, Gabbai recommended the closure of the Israeli branch, which closed in late 2008. During his role he studied the Israeli branch infrastructure and the tenders participation, Sorek desalination and a solar power plant construction Ashalim. Additionally, he also negotiated the purchase of controlling interest in Gama Management & Clearing, but it was sold to Phoenix Holdings Ltd.\n",

He went to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1997 as a choral scholar where he sang under Christopher Robinson and studied law; he was part of, and occasionally directed, \"The Gentlemen of St John's.\"  He also sang with \"Collegium Regale,\" the modern-day equivalent of The King's Singers at King's College, and Cibus Amoris, and enjoyed a full part in university musical life, singing in and directing numerous performances of diverse choral repertoire. After graduating in 2000 with a bachelor's degree in law, he attended the Oxford Institute of Legal Practice and sang as a lay clerk in the choir of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. In 2001, he began training to be a lawyer with the London firm, Stephenson Harwood, qualifying as a Solicitor of the Supreme Court in 2003.\nWhilst practising as a lawyer he maintained his singing career, performing with many groups including Polyphony, The English Concert, The King's Consort, and in the inaugural concert of European Voices in a performance of Wagner's \"Parsifal\" at the BBC Proms under Sir Simon Rattle. He also sang as a Gentleman of the Temple Church (of \"Da Vinci Code\" fame) under Stephen Layton, where he performed in Sir John Tavener's epic work \"The Veil of the Temple\" in 2003.\nHe joined the King's Singers as their 2nd Baritone in early 2004, following an extensive audition process, deciding to put his legal career on hold. During his time in the group he acted as Managing Partner and effective in-house legal counsel, presiding over a successful period of growth and renewal in the ensemble's history, and celebrating both the group's 40th and 50th Anniversaries in 2008 and 2018 respectively. Gabbitas toured across six continents, performing around 2,000 concerts in over 50 countries worldwide and recording in excess of 30 albums during his tenure in the group. During this time, Gabbitas made several broadcasts for BBC Radio 4, presenting documentaries which looked at aspects of the singing voice and choral performance. He left the ensemble, along with Countertenor Timothy Wayne-Wright, at the end of 2018.\nIn The King's Singers 50th Anniversary GOLD Book, Gabbitas credits his initial colleagues in the ensemble, including David Hurley, Philip Lawson and Stephen Connolly, as being formative influences in his continuing musical career. Hurley and Connolly, in particular, sang with two of the original members of the group and were therefore easily able to pass down the principles of sound, balance and blend that were the hallmarks of the early group's performances and recordings. Lawson's arranging style, which owed much to Bob Chilcott (another former member of The King's Singers), informed Gabbitas' own choral arrangements and position on building choral sound from the bass upwards.\nIn early 2019 Gabbitas was appointed artistic director of the Phoenix Chorale, an American Grammy Award-winning chamber ensemble based in Phoenix, Arizona, succeeding Charles Bruffy. As Artistic Director Gabbitas has started a new path for the Phoenix Chorale by doing a Master Works Program.  During the same year Gabbitas also took up a position as Artist Professor at the University of Redlands in California, USA, teaching a unique Master of Music degree in Vocal Chamber Music and Commercial Music-Making.\nHe maintains a position as consultant solicitor with Keystone Law, recognised as one of the most innovative legal service providers in the UK, advising on creative commercial matters.\nWhilst on tour in America in late 2004 he met Stephanie Seales, a musical theatre actress and successful businesswoman who set up one of the largest babyballet franchise operations in the UK.\nThey married in the summer of 2006 in America and England, and with their three daughters divide their time between a home in England and family in the US.\n\n\n== References ==\n",

            "early_life": "Gene Ha was born in Chicago and raised in South Bend, Indiana. According to Ha, his parents were well-educated Korean immigrants whose aspiration was that their three sons would obtain prestigious degrees and enter corresponding careers. Gene was the most introverted of his brothers, a \"geek\" who sought out escapist fantasy particularly through comic books. Whilst his siblings displayed impressive artistic talent, they lacked the patience to sit for hours on end applying themselves to illustration. Ha notes parallels between his generation of Asian-American comics artists and the generation of Jewish creators from the 1930s, both of whom were children of immigrants struggling to fit into America. Ha cites as his influences numerous creators from the 1980s, such as John Byrne, Frank Miller, Bill Sienkiewicz, Walter Simonson, Alan Moore, and most importantly Matt Wagner, whose Mage series Ha says is still \"epic\" to him, and its main characters \"personal archetypes\". Ha took few classes in art, as he was only interested in drawing as a means of creating comics, and South Bend offered little in the way of education in realistic drawing. He began to truly understand graphic arts when working on his high school newspaper, The Clay Colonial, winning the Most Valuable Staffer Award, which was unusual for an artist. After high school, Ha attended the College for Creative Studies. In his last semester he sent drawing samples to Marvel and DC. Although he received a harshly critical response from Marvel, DC was interested and sent him a sample script.\nHa's first published comics work was in Green Lantern vol. 3 #36 (Feb. 1993), whose story, \"The Ghost of Christmas Light\", was written by Gerard Jones. He would draw a number of comics for DC and Malibu Comics, and did work for Marvel as well, illustrating the 1994 miniseries The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix, which documented the childhood of the character Cable. He would draw that miniseries' sequel as well, Askani'son.\nHa was one of the artists on the Shade limited series which spun off from the Starman series. He would subsequently illustrate a number of different properties for various publishers, including Aliens: Havoc, Superman, JLA Annual, which included interiors and cover work.

Ha drew two issues, but the project stalled after the second issue, as DC needed Morrison to concentrate his efforts on Batman rather than on Wildstorm projects.In a December 2013 interview, Ha announced a sabbatical from work for hire comics and expressed his desire to focus on creator-owned projects.In June 2015, Dark Horse Comics selected for publication Ha's creator-owned series Mae, which Ha funded through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter.

The series holds a 7.8 out of 10 rating at the review aggregator website Comic Book Round Up, based on 35 reviews.\nHa and his wife Lisa live in Berwyn, Illinois.\n",

His father opposed art as well as music, but he eventually let Ha go to the college to study art. He quit music for a while after entering the university. Although his life in the university was short, his interest in art and aesthetics also became a driving force for image music in the future by forming a big axis in Guckkasten's music.

He was motivated by a bookseller who visited the school and purchased a series of books on modern Korean literature. Thereafter, readings of Korean literature sparked his interest in writing and philosophy. In this process, Ha began to question humanity and thing-in-itself. During the high school years, Ha's spiritual journey continued. He pursued truth, the meaning of life and humanity in Buddhism, Hinduism and other major religions. In this spiritual journey, he read many western philosophical classics.\nHa was influenced by the works of Sigmund Freud, Carl Gustav Jung, Immanuel Kant and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. Ha experienced spiritual progression recognizing the importance and meaning of human existence, and the 'despair' of Kierkegaard and the 'reason' of Kant became a less serious issue to his life and study. At the end of 12th grade, Ha had a mystical religious experience that made him confess that God is the only answer to his quest for meaning. Ha then became a Christian. His poetry became an artistic stimulus for artists in parts of England and America.\nHa became a Presbyterian minister and a professor of historical theology at Korea Presbyterian Theological Seminary. He teaches Biblical Exposition. Ha established Korea Presbyterian Church and the Korea Presbyterian Seminary, serving as Pastoral General, Christian education, Missions etc., at his own expense.\n\nHa presented the historical point of view of the Orthodox Church, describing how the confession of faith and the historical context coincide.

            "early_life": "Haack was born in Wausau, Wisconsin on November 1, 1946. He received a B.S. (Honors) from the University of Wisconsin in geography in 1969 and a geography M.A. from San Diego State University in 1971; Haack received a Ph.D. in geography from the University of Michigan in 1977. While at San Diego State University working as a teaching assistant for Dr. William Finch, a pioneer in the field of remote sensing, Haack was introduced to the study of the earth through aircraft and satellite imagery. That interest was the primary reason Haack chose to attend the University of Michigan; in Ann Arbor, Haack studied under professors Thomas Detwyler, Charles Olsen, and Waldo Tobler.\nWhile a graduate student at the University of Michigan, Haack was employed by the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM), initially as a research assistant and later as a research scientist. ERIM was one of the leading remote sensing organizations in the world at the time. At ERIM, Haack was involved in a number or research projects. Those that most influenced his career involved the transfer of satellite based remote sensing to developing countries. With other ERIM scientists, Haack traveled to Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh for multiple presentations and collection of field data. One of the specific projects was to employ Landsat satellite imagery to evaluate winter rice distribution in Bangladesh using regression analysis estimation techniques. Because his professional goal was to enter academia, Haack left ERIM to take a faculty position in geography at Ball State University in Indiana in 1978. While teaching in Indiana, Haack also served as an instructor for USAID workshops on technology transfer of remote sensing in Swaziland and Kenya.\nAs a basic research academic, Haack was one of the initial remote sensing scientists to integrate data from optical and radar sensors. Many of his publications are based upon this research activity. Early in his academic career, Haack had fellowships at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at the California Institute of Technology. It was at JPL in 1981 that Haack first integrated optical and radar data and began publishing scientific articles on the topic.\nAs an extension of his Africa workshop participations, in 1981 Haack was offered a position as a remote sensing expert at the USAID funded Regional Remote Sensing Facility (RRSF) in Nairobi and worked there until 1983. RRSF served about 27 countries in East and Southern Africa on the technology transfer of primarily Landsat imagery through training programs, demonstration projects, and distribution of imagery. While at the RRSF, Haack began to employ satellite imagery to monitor the Omo River Delta in Lake Turkana. \nDuring the 1980s, Haack received funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to work with Sudanese scientists to evaluate the utility of spaceborne radar for mapping in Sudan. Haack and his students frequently used the second largest city in Sudan, Wad Madani, along the Blue Nile and associated large Gezira irrigation area as a study site. \nIn 1984 he began to conduct remote sensing training for a USAID-funded National Remote Sensing Centre in Kathmandu, Nepal. That experience led to at least 15 additional professional visits to Nepal for remote sensing and GIS initiatives.Haack was appointed Associate Professor of Geographic and Cartographic Sciences in the Geography Program at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia in 1985. He taught courses in physical geography and remote sensing as well as served as an advisor for master and doctoral students. Many of his students obtained prominent positions in science, policy, and intelligence areas both in the federal government and commercial companies as well as entering academia.\nHaack also taught remote sensing workshops for NASA and other federal agencies, the European Space Agency in The Netherlands and at multiple international venues including Syria, Afghanistan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Peru, Suriname, and Ecuador. For the academic year 1994-1995, Haack was a Fulbright Professor in the Department of Geography at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. While in Dar es Salaam and with scientists from Kenya and Tanzania, Haack obtained NASA support to evaluate combined radar and optical satellite imagery to study refugee camps. One of the camps later visited was Dadaab in Eastern Kenya.\nIn addition to the international technology transfer activities already cited, Haack has also been supported by USDA, USGS, US Census, World Bank, United Nations, National Geographic Society, US Air Force, International Union for the Conservation of Nature, International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, InterAmerican Development Bank, and directly by foreign governmental entities. Those activities have included program development and evaluation, training, as well as basic and applied science. Other professionally visited countries include Indonesia, Fiji, Mozambique, Thailand, China, Namibia, Malawi, Zambia, and Ethiopia.\nHaack was involved in national mapping activities in multiple countries. In Afghanistan, that effort was in support of the evaluation and improvement of the agricultural sector. A specific focus was changes in the Helmand-Arghandab irrigation scheme. His multiple activities in Suriname included advising on the conversion of all land ownership information to digital format as well as the social environmental impact of a proposed bauxite mine in the interior rainforest. In Nepal, he mapped urban expansion in the Kathmandu Valley and was the Chief Technical Advisor for a large international programme to develop improved management tools for the high mountains including Mount Everest. \nHaack has been on the editorial board for several scientific journals, including GIScience and Remote Sensing. He has also been active his entire career with the major scientific organization in his field, ASPRS. In 2006, Haack was elected a Fellow in ASPRS on the first ballot, a significant recognition in his scientific community.\n",

In 1959, Haacke was hired to assist with the second documenta, working as a guard and tour guide. He was a student of Stanley William Hayter, a well-known and influential English printmaker, draftsman, and painter. From 1961 to 1962, he studied on a Fulbright grant at the Tyler School of Art at Temple University in Philadelphia. From 1967 to 2002, Haacke was a professor at the Cooper Union in New York City.\n\nDuring his formative years in Germany, he was a member of Zero (an international group of artists, active ca. 1957\u20131966). This group was held together with common motivations: the longing to re-harmonize man and nature and to restore art's metaphysical dimension. They sought to organize the pictorial surface without using traditional devices.\nAlthough their methods differed greatly, most of the work was monochromatic, geometric, kinetic, and gestural. But most of all they used nontraditional materials such as industrial materials, fire and water, light, and kinetic effects. The influence of the Zero group and the materials they used is clear in Haacke's early work from his paintings that allude to movement and expression to his early installations that are formally minimal and use earthly elements as materials.These early installations focused on systems and processes. Condensation Cube (1963\u201365) embodies a physical occurrence, of the condensation cycle, in real time. Some of the themes in these works from the 1960s include the interactions of physical and biological systems, living animals, plants, and the states of water and the wind. He also made forays into land art, but by the end of the 1960s, his art had found a more specific focus.\n",

            "early_life": "Jan Haag (n\u00e9e Smith), born in Marysville, WA, grew up in the Pacific Northwest, graduated from Seattle's Holy Names Academy, and went on to study art and painting at Burnley School for Professional Art. Haag continued her studies at the Art Institute of Chicago, Reed College in Portland, Oregon, The New School for Social Research in New York, University of Washington, Pennsylvania State University, UCLA, and Southwestern University School of Law. Haag also studied painting with Frederick E. Smith, dance with Eleanor King, and singing and tabla with Ali Akbar Khan and Swapan Chaudhuri.\nIn Seattle, Haag managed poetry readings, an art gallery, and the Shakespeare Workshop for ABC Bookstore. As an actress, she performed in regional theaters during the 1950s and 1960s, and directed plays in Washington, Oregon and California. Haag has exhibited her work in West Coast museums, competitions, and galleries\u2014including the Seattle Art Museum, the Frye Museum, the Otto Seligman Gallery, and the Woessner Gallery.\nIn Los Angeles, Haag served as Film and Television Director for the John Tracy Clinic, where she directed a series of forty-two films, \"Teaching Speech to the Profoundly Deaf,\" for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. In 1971 she joined the staff of the American Film Institute where, as Director of National Production Programs, she administered the nation's largest film granting program, the Independent Filmmaker Program, funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1974, with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, she founded AFI's Directing Workshop for Women, a program in which accomplished women\u2014such as Joanne Woodward, Lee Grant, Margot Kidder, Ellen Burstyn, Maya Angelou, Karen Arthur, Anne Bancroft, Dyan Cannon, Julie Phillips, Kathleen Nolan, Cicely Tyson, Brianne Murphy, Nessa Hyams, and Randa Haines could develop their directing skills. The DWW became the fountainhead back to which the careers of many women, now directing film and television, can be traced. Haag also served on the boards of many film festivals/programs, including the Bellevue Film Festival, Filmex, the Sundance Institute, and the International Women Filmmakers Symposium.\nBetween 1975 and 2008, Haag created twenty-three needlepoint canvases, working on some of these simultaneously. One work took ten years to complete. The more complex of these canvases required hundreds, sometimes thousands of hours of application. An accomplished painter and poet familiar with different mediums, Haag writes of the textile art medium: \u201cCompared with the roughhouse immediacy of painting and sculpture, one can cite many a rug, tapestry, piece of stitchery which took a year to make or, at times, a decade. Back and back and back, millennia by millennia, the history and lore of weaving/stitchery recedes as we, at the near end of the time scale, proceed -- cloth, grid arts, fractals and computer -- into the future.\u201d\nHaag explains: \u201cOver the years, working on these pieces has become one of my primary ways of understanding both the world and my experience of it. The works\u2026 transmit knowledge. Not only the powerful subjective awareness of light and color, but the pleasure associated with study -- in this case, study of music, astronomy, mathematics, travel, archaeology, and the iconographic, mystical and esoteric traditions of many cultures.\u201dThese textile pieces became a life\u2019s work. Through determined experimentation and applying techniques and iconography learned from a lifetime of travel, including treks on foot alone through India, Korea, China, Thailand, Nepal, Russia and Europe, Haag would forever change the perceptions and possibilities of needlepoint.In 1982, Haag retired from AFI to focus on her art and writing. She has written thousands of poems and given poetry readings in theaters, museums, libraries, galleries, and private salons. A limited edition of \"Amanita Caesarea\", a legend, with original drawings by Roger Landry, was published by Gallery Plus in Los Angeles. Haag has written stories, novels, plays, film scripts, articles, essays, and a vast journal\u2014the manuscripts of which are on deposit in Special Collections at the Blagg Huey Library of Texas Woman's University in Denton, TX. Haag's travel stories have appeared in four of the prize-winning Traveler's Tales series of books: India, A Woman's World, The Spiritual Gifts of Travel, and Spain. During a 1991 writer's fellowship at the Syvenna Foundation in Texas, Haag wrote a novel Cantalloc. In 1992, during a writer's fellowship at Blue Mountain Center in New York, she completed No Palms, a California/Texas novel centering on water rights, real estate fraud, and murder. After 50 years of research and study, in 2009, Haag published Jocasta, an original play based on the Oedipus myth seen from Jocasta's point of view. Ascesis, a 600-page volume of poetry, was published in 2014.\nHaag was married for ten years, 1957\u201368, to John Haag, Professor and Poet-in-Residence at Pennsylvania State University. Haag currently resides within the Seattle metropolitan area.\n",

She has held numerous fellowships, including a Mellon Fellowship in the Humanities, a National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship, and postdoctoral positions at both Brown and Rutgers universities.\nHaag\u2019s essays, books, and opinion address a broad range of topics.Her first book was a scholarly monograph, Consent: Sexual Rights and the Transformation of American Liberalism (Cornell University Press, 1999). It discusses the \"transition from classic to modern liberalism, and the cultural emergence of a concept of a right to privacy and sexual liberty, decades before the concept became legally prominent in the late 1900s\".Haag was the Director of Research for the AAUW Educational Foundation for five years and, while there, published research on girls' insights about their challenges in school life, called \"Voices of a Generation\" (Marlowe, 2000).Marriage Confidential: Love in the Post-Romantic Age (HarperCollins, 2012), is cultural commentary about the state of 21st-century marriage. It explores the dilemma of the \"semi-happy\" couple\u2014not miserable in marriage but not content, either\u2014and it discusses how some couples are redefining marriage. Among others, The Washington Post reviewed it as \"flat-out brilliant\"; Publishers Weekly gave it a starred review, and it was chosen by the Huffington Post as one of the notable and important books of the season.\nThe Gunning of America: Business and the Making of American Gun Culture (Basic Books, 2016) highlights the gun industry rather than gun owners. The book delves into the historical archives of the Winchester and Colt\u2019s corporations, and the ghostly legend of gun heiress Sarah Winchester. Gunning argues among other things that the gun mystique truly flourished and developed not on the frontier of the 1800s but in the urban, modern, \u201cpost-frontier\u201d America of the 1900s.  Haag pays particular attention to how the gun industry itself worked to build markets, both in the U.S. and, crucially, abroad.  She argues that the gun shifted from something that Americans needed but didn't especially love in the 1800s to something that they loved but didn't especially need in the 1900s.The Gunning of America was praised as \"beautifully composed\", \"brilliant\", \"remarkable\", and \"masterful\" in reviews, including The New Republic, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, the San Francisco Chronicle, The New York Review of Books, Maclean's, Time, and others. It received a starred review in Publishers Weekly.The Gunning of America was named a best book of 2016 by Kirkus Reviews, The Washington Post, and the San Francisco Chronicle, and an outstanding academic title by Choice. It was excerpted in The Wall Street Journal, Politico, and Salon.Haag has also published in places such as: The American Scholar, NPR, The Christian Science Monitor, Slate, Huffington Post, Ms., The Washington Post, The Chronicle of Higher Education, New York Post, Michigan Quarterly Review, The Antioch Review, New Haven Review, and The Times (London), as well as peer-reviewed academic journals.

At age 16, she moved to Paris with the trapeze artists from the circus and debuted at the Parisian nightclub Alcazar as a cabaret dancer.\nIn 1972, an American show manager offered Haag a tour booking and she performed her show \"Berlin Chanson\" at Fire Island, in Long Island and Atlantic City. There she met and fell in love with a street musician from Berlin and decided to move back to Europe to live in the German city with him.In 1974, at age 26, she opened her own cabaret, named Chez Romy Haag, in Berlin-Sch\u00f6neberg. Visitors to the venue included Udo Lindenberg, Zizi Jeanmaire, Patricia Highsmith, Bryan Ferry, Tina Turner, Horst Buchholz, Grace Jones, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Iggy Pop, Freddie Mercury, Lou Reed and Mick Jagger, whom she first met in 1973. In 1976, Haag and David Bowie began a romantic relationship; Bowie subsequently moved to Berlin and completed his first German tour.Her first single \"Liege-Samba\" appeared in 1977, with Udo Lindenberg contributing the lyrics and music. She went on tour with Lindenberg, and in the following year, released her single \"Superparadise\". In 1979, the New Yorker Profile Gallery profiled her in a photo tribute. In 1981, her first album So bin ich, with Klaus Hoffmann contributing the lyrics, was released.\nAfter nine years, in 1983, she sold her night club to travel the world.

Muir attended Palmers Cross All-Age School and then Garvey Maceo High School, and would often sing and make noises during class. Muir briefly attended Knox Community College with a focus on architecture, but dropped out to pursue his recording career full-time. Muir began his recording career at the age of 16, when he was introduced to Donovan Germain of Penthouse Records, then manager of such artists as Buju Banton and Assassin. Muir released his first singles, \"Oh Jah\" and \"Stepp a Seed\", in 2000 at Penthouse Records under the moniker Richie Rich.  After meeting Junior Arrows of the Arrows Recording Company, Muir signed onto the Kingston label under the new name I-Octane, a play on high-octane fuel and the Rastafarian use of I.  I-Octane's initial acclaim came in 2007 for his social commentary works such as the roots reggae track \"Stab Vampire\" which climbed to the top of several Jamaican charts.  In 2009, I-Octane topped the charts again with his emotional songs \"Mama You Alone\" and \"Lose A Friend\", and the latter of which was later adapted as a tribute to those who died during the police manhunt for Christopher \"Dudus\" Coke in Tivoli Gardens.When I-Octane left Arrows over financial disputes, the artist came under the guidance of Robert Livingston, a veteran producer who had been responsible for the success of such artists as Super Cat and Shaggy.  I-Octane gained further traction in 2010 with a string of hits produced by Cashflow Records, including \"No Love Inna Dem\" and the cannabis anthem \"Puff It,\" which was named as one of NPR's Top 5 Dancehall Tracks of 2011.  He also topped the charts once again with the contemplative \"My Life\" produced by DJ Frass, and was featured in the April\u2013May issue of the hip hop magazine Vibe.  The same year, he also signed on as Brand Ambassador for the telecommunications firm Digicel, and as of 2013 he remains employed as a representative of the company. I-Octane has also been the Brand Ambassador for the Golden Eagle Brand in Jamaica since 2015.\nIn 2011, I-Octane announced he would be starting his own record label, Conquer The Globe Productions, which would serve to produce instrumentals for him and promote him as an artist.  He also said the label's first release would be an extended play in December of that year to be followed by an album in early 2012.  The six-song EP, \"Straight From The Heart,\" was released on 7 December as a primarily digital release, with distribution by TuneCore.  The EP was marketed towards a global audience and three of its songs were recorded in the U.S., a first for the artist.  The EP's lead single \"Burn Dem Bridge,\" produced by Stephen \"Di Genius\" McGregor, topped several charts in Jamaica and received significant radio airplay, including on international stations such as New York's Hot 97.I-Octane's debut album, Crying To The Nation, was released on 13 February 2012 through Robert Livingston's Scikron Entertainment in the Caribbean and VP Records internationally.  The album received generally positive reviews from critics.  Rick Anderson of AllMusic praised the record as a \"solid winner\", but mentioned it relied a little too strongly on Auto-Tune, and David Katz of BBC Music called the album \"a surprisingly varied set, comprising mostly new roots reggae in the one drop style, along with a couple of rougher-edged tracks in full-on dancehall mode\".  The album's lead single was the lovers rock ballad \"L.O.V.E. Y.O.U.\", which was marketed to international audiences but also did well domestically.  I-Octane followed the album with a tour of the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and ended the year strong with a string of hit singles, including \"Badmind Dem A Pree\", a collaboration with Bounty Killer produced by Buju Banton's son Markus Myrie, the summer hit \"Love Di Vibes\", and the Seanizzle-produced \"Gal A Gimmi Bun\", a song in which I-Octane laments his partner's infidelity.In March 2013, I-Octane was selected as brand ambassador for the Caribbean soft drink Busta, a product of S. M. Jaleel and Company.His second album, the DJ Frass-produced My Journey, was released in March 2014 on Tad's International Records. He continued to work with DJ Frass on the 2015 EP New Chapter.In March 2018, I-Octane's Love and Life album was released and debuted at #3 on the reggae Billboard where it stayed for 3 weeks. The Album was produced executively by I-Octane under his Conquer The Globe Production label, he worked with a new of producers and artistes.\nIn 2021 he released the album Moods, followed by I am Great (2022), which was preceded by the single \"Sorry\".\n",

Since 1978 he has been at Yale University, where he is at present J. W. Gibbs professor for physics and chemistry.\nIachello received the Chiaudano prize in 1968  and was a Fulbright Fellow in 1964. He was awarded in 1990 the Wigner Medal, in 1991 both the Taormina Prize and the Dutch AKZO Prize, and in 1993, along with Akito Arima, the Tom W. Bonner Prize of the American Physical Society. Iachello became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996. He is also member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences. In 1997 he received the Centennial Prize of the Italian Physical Society. In 2002 he received the Meitner Prize of the European Physical Society. He has honorary doctorates from the University of Ferrara, the University of Seville, and Chung Yuan University in China.\nIachello is famous for the application of algebraic methods (Lie algebras) to the investigation of the spectra of atomic nuclei and molecules. In 1974 with Akito Arima he introduced the \"Interacting Boson Model\" into nuclear physics. This important model describes collective nuclear states with the help of the unitary group U(6). The underlying concept is to derive a model with pairs of neutrons and protons instead of unpaired nucleons. The pairs are treated as bosons with different quantum spin (s- and d- bosons, as named according to spin 0 and 2). In an extension of the model, the analogous effect with unpaired fermions has a description using supersymmetrical algebras.In recent times he has worked mainly on the investigation of the quantum mechanical dynamics of molecules (e.g. quantum phase transitions, polymer dynamics) with algebraic methods, on which Iachello already began to work in 1981 (Vibron Model).\n",

Iacobucci earned a bachelor's degree (honours) in economics from Queen's University, a Master of Philosophy degree, also in economics, from the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Toronto. From 1996 to 1997, he clerked for John Sopinka, a justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nIacobucci joined the University of Toronto Faculty of Law in 1998. In 2002, he was a John M. Olin visiting fellow at Columbia University Law School. He has also been a visiting professor at New York University Law School and the University of Chicago Law School.In 2003, Iacobucci, along with Paul Collins, Michael Trebilock, and Ralph Winter won the Canadian Economics Association's Doug Purvis Memorial Prize for their book The Law and Economics of Canadian Competition Policy.In 2011, Iacobucci was appointed as the C. D. Howe Institute's Competition Policy Scholar, and was reappointed to that position in 2015. Iacobucci, along with Lawson Hunter and Michael Trebilcock were co-authors in a 2014 C.D. Howe Institute study called \"Let the Market Decide: The Case against Mandatory Pick-And-Pay\" about the Canadian telecommunications and broadcasting industry.In 2016, during Iacobucci's tenure as dean, the University of Toronto Faculty of Law created the J.R. Kimber Chair for Investment Rights, which was the first research chair for investor rights in North America; the position was first held by future federal cabinet minister Anita Anand.Iacobucci is an independent member of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC)'s board of directors and the chair of its Corporate Governance Committee.Mid-September 2020 articles in the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail  \u2014based on interviews and corroborated by correspondence between the university and faculty staff\u2014alleged that Iacobucci had rescinded an offer to legal scholar Valentina Azarova to become the director of the faculty's International Human Rights Program (IHRP), under pressure from Justice David Spiro, a member of the Tax Court of Canada, who is an alumnus of and donor to the university. According to the Star , Azarova\u2014who was the faculty advisory board's \"unanimous choice\"\u2014had accepted the offer of the IHRP directorship in mid-August. In a mid-September letter to Iacobucci, two former IHRP directors, told the dean, that the Tax Court judge had expressed his concerns about Azarova's research on Israeli occupation\u2014specifically her criticism of Israel's settlements in Palestine\u2014to the administration. Shortly after, Azarova's offer was rescinded. A University of Haifa Faculty of Law associate professor, said that Azarova's  criticism of Israel and the settlements was not \"exotic\", but rather a \"kind of majority position around the world\"\u2014a \"long-standing criticism\" of \"human rights violations of international law\". In protest, the entire advisory board resigned en masse. In an October 14 email,  Dean Iacobucci told professors that he had ordered an impartial review of the hiring process which will result in a January 2021 report. The announcement came amid calls from \"lawyers, academics, rights groups and public intellectuals from around the world\" for an independent review. The Canadian Judicial Council is \"considering multiple complaints\" against Justice Spiro. According to the Globe and Mail, Justice Spiro and his extended family, including the Tanenbaum's, have been generous donors over the years to the university. Dean Iacobucci denies any wrongdoing and says the reason for rescinding the offer to Azarova was related to an immigration technicality. The pro-Israel B'nai Brith Canada's CEO, Michael Mostyn said that preventing Azarova hiring was a \"sound decision.\" The Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) voted to censure U of T in protest of the external interference on academic freedom. The censure requested academics not to accept job offers or attend conferences and events at the university until Dr. Azarova's offer was reinstated. As a result of the censure, several events at the university were cancelled or postponed, including the UofT Tedx conference. Groups that support the censure include Amnesty International, the National Lawyers Guild, the Indigenous Education Network, and the HIV Legal Network.In December 2020, the Faculty of Law announced that Jutta Brunn\u00e9e would succeed Iacobucci as dean, starting January 2021.\n",

Her father's work for a shipping company meant the family moved a lot. She was later mentored by Leopoldo Presas, a member of the Academia Nacional de Bellas Artes de Argentina (National Academy of Fine Arts) and President of Sociedad Argentina de Artistas Pl\u00e1sticos. She also studied with Julio G\u00fcero, Maria Luisa Manasero, and Ana Eckell, who represented Argentina at 1997 Venice Biennale. She completed her school education at Northlands School and got her college degree at the Santa Ana School of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires in 1980. Later Iacona attended the Sorbonne in Paris.\nDuring the 80s, Iacona moved to Punta del Este, Uruguay where she worked as a professional landscape designer planning and designing gardens and parks. This later became the basis of her floral art. She would work during the day, and paint at night. Her flowers are a synthesis of what she sees, rather than photorealistic renditions of her subjects.In the late 80s Iacona moved back to Argentina where she started showing her paintings in Buenos Aires galleries. She also participated in the Centro de Arte y Comunicaci\u00f3n (CAYC) Biennal organized by art critic Jorge Glusberg. In 1990, the Argentine Museo Nacional de Arte Decorativo selected one of her works, Sunset Flowers, as a state present to China. It became one of the first works by an Argentinian artist in the Hangzhou Art Center's collection.\nIn 1992 she moved to Kinsale, Ireland to participate in a collective exhibition which lead to a year of work there. In 1993, she moved to Paris to work on her flower artworks and commissioned portraits. Her work then took her to America where she first lived in Austin, Texas, where she worked on a site-specific work for a Catholic chapel. After Austin, she spent two years in New Orleans, before moving to New York in 1996 where she continued to work till 1999. In 1998, one of her works was selected to participate in the Sal\u00f3n Nacional de Artes Pl\u00e1sticas at Palais de Glace, Buenos Aires. That year, the exhibition was held in the city of Paran\u00e1, Entre R\u00edos.\nWith the nomination for Sal\u00f3n Nacional, she traveled to Argentina and decided to stay and reconnect with her Argentine roots and fellow artists. She studied aesthetics with professor and researcher Lucas Salvador Fragasso. \"El debate est\u00e9tico contempor\u00e1neo\" (Contemporary Aesthetics Debate) evolved around concepts such as aesthetic experience, artistic autonomy, artwork analysis based on philosophic texts from Adorno, Benjamin, Heidegger and others such as Hal Foster, Georges Didi-Huberman and Rosalind Krauss. In 2000 she gave birth to her daughter. During that period, she started painting flowers on larger canvases and many of her works focused on pop portraits of children, commissioned by friends and others. By 2014, requests for commissioned works from Europe had accumulated and she and her daughter moved to London, returning to Argentina in 2016.\n",

At a young age, Iaconelli was introduced to fishing on summer trips to the Pocono Mountains. On these trips, he was first introduced to other types of fishing besides bass fishing. His first experiences were with trout and various panfish species. His first largemouth bass catch came at age twelve during his family's annual summer trek to the Pocono Mountains. Iaconelli used a 9S Floating Rapala lure to catch the bass. According to Iaconelli, this moment sparked his interest in bass fishing. His love for bass fishing continued on into high school.\nAfter high school, Iaconelli founded the bass fishing club, \"Top Rod Bassmasters\". Top Rod Bassmasters became Iaconelli's first venture into competitive bass fishing. The club had inter-club tournaments among its members. In 1992, after three years of fishing in Top Rod Bassmasters, Iaconelli made the transition to the pro-am circuit. His first tournament on this circuit was the North Carolina Top 100. This event was held on  Lake Norman in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. In this tournament, Iaconelli drew widely known fisherman, Tommy Biffle.  In the following days of the North Carolina Top 100, he would also draw well-known fishermen David Fritts and Gary Klein. In 1994, Iaconelli once again fished the North Carolina Top 100 on Lake Norman. At this tournament, he won his first bass boat. The boat he won was a new Ranger 374.After Iaconelli won a Ranger 374, he began to tackle the Red Man and Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (B.A.S.S.) Federation trails. In 1997, Iaconelli fished a B.A.S.S. Invitational Tournament on Buggs Island, also known as Kerr Lake. The first day, he was paired with the four-time Bassmaster Classic champion, Kevin VanDam. One of Iaconelli's earliest tournament victories came on New Jersey's Lake Hopatcong. In this Federation tournament, he broke the lake and one-day Federation record of just over 18 pounds. His official weight for that tournament was 19.58 lbs.In 1999, Iaconelli qualified for the Bassmaster Federation Nationals on the Red River. He would go on to win the event as he qualified for the 1999 Bassmaster Classic berth after the victory. The 1999 Bassmaster Classic was held on the Louisiana Delta in New Orleans, Louisiana. At the 1999 Bassmaster Classic, Classic rookie Iaconelli caught a three-day total of 39 lbs and 12 oz. That total netted him a sixth-place finish. The great finish at the Bassmaster Classic culminated in Dick's Sporting Goods and Daiwa becoming major sponsors for Iaconelli.  In September of the same year, Iaconelli collected his first victory in the professional ranks by winning the Bassmaster Vermont Top 150 on Lake Champlain. Michael Iaconelli bagged over 61 lbs of bass and a $100,000 check. In 2000, Iaconelli made the leap to the professional ranks. He began fishing the B.A.S.S Tour.    Again, Iaconelli qualified for the Bassmaster Classic. The 2000 Bassmaster Classic was held on Lake Michigan in Chicago, Illinois. He was able to net a top finish with a three-day weight total of 20 lbs 1 oz.In 2002, Iaconelli started the season with a victory on Lake Seminole. The victory on Lake Seminole was the first Tour level victory for Iaconelli.  He qualified for the 2003 Bassmaster Classic after a ninth-place victory at the B.A.S.S. Invitational on Lake Ontario.\n-Bassmaster: http://www.bassmaster.com/anglers/michael-iaconelli\n-Major League Fishing: https://www.majorleaguefishing.com/angler-detail/mike-iaconelli/5388\n-Fishing League Worldwide (FLW): https://web.archive.org/web/20120305061103/http://www.flwoutdoors.com/community/profile/home.cfm?uid=102108\nMike is married to Rebecca \"Becky\" Iaconelli and he has four children: Drew, Rylie, Vegas, and Estella.

In her sophomore year, she began working for and researching with petrologist Gordon Moore. She then pursued her doctoral degree at the University of Cambridge.\nIacovino's work has involved carefully negotiated diplomatic relations with countries such as North Korea. During one of these trips, she worked alongside a team of their scientists as the only woman involved. She was the first female scientist to ever conduct traveling research in North Korea and was also the only American on this expedition. Iacovino is part of a small group of women in volcanology, but is highly respected for her work ethic and strength.Iacovino's work in North Korea is part of an international effort (which includes American, British, North Korean, and Chinese colleagues) to understand Mount Paektu, an volcano located on the border between North Korea and China. The work is led by British scientists Clive Oppenheimer (Iacovino's PhD supervisor) and James Hammond and was recently featured in the Werner Herzog documentary \"Into the Inferno\". The group's work has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Notably, the publications include both western and North Korean co-authors.In 2012, Iacovino also studied Erta Ale in Ethiopia. During this, her team was the target of a high-profile attempt to capture and imprison Westerners. Due to a delay in traveling, this was not successful - although several other tourists were harmed.Currently, Iacovino is working for NASA. Iacovino was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at Arizona State University. Iacovino previously held a National Science Foundation Post-Doctoral Fellowship at the United States Department of the Interior US Geological Survey. She recreates magma chambers with experimental petrology, characterizes rock samples, measures volcanic degassing, and performs thermodynamic modeling.She has also published articles in scientific journals, lectured at universities such as Arizona State University, and presented around the world. Additionally, she received many research grants, including the AAAS Research Grant most recently.\nIacovino is the Editor-in-Chief of TrekMovie.com, as a longstanding Star Trek fan. She believes that science fiction is a useful tool in helping the public gain interest in science. She was also inspired by  Kate Mulgrew's character - the first female captain of Star Trek. Mulgrew has since met with Iacovino and noted that unlike Iacovino, she \"only played one [scientist] on TV.\"Iacovino is involved in encouraging young women to pursue STEM careers, such as with projects like the Curiosity Science Program created through a Gold Award Project by one of BBC's 100 Women of 2016, Erin McKenney. In this program, Iacovino described her own career as one that requires curiosity, interest in the world, and a willingness to get your hands dirty.

            "early_life": "Iacovou was born in the village of Peristeronopigi, in Famagusta District. He graduated from the Famagusta Gymnasium. From 1955 to 1960, Iacovou was a student in the United Kingdom and was active in student politics and Greek Cypriot community affairs.\nFrom 1960 until 1964, Iacovou worked in the private sector in Cyprus. He worked as a Senior Consultant at the international enterprise Price Waterhouse in London, as Principal Officer for Operational Research and later on as Senior Finance Officer of the board of directors for British Rail. In 1972, he returned to Cyprus from the United Kingdom, and was appointed Director of the Cyprus Productivity Centre, where he introduced new management methods in industry and commerce, pioneering programmes for continuing education of business executives, such as a post-graduate management course that has been running for over thirty years. He also turned his attention to the upgrading of skills of artisans and technicians in many fields. Concurrently, Iacovou was Chairman of the board of directors of the Hotel and Catering Institute of Cyprus (\"HCI\"), and under his stewardship, the HCI became internationally known, being acknowledged accordingly on the island.\nFollowing the Turkish invasion of 1974, he established and directed the \"Service for the Relief and Rehabilitation of Displaced Persons\" on directions from the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cyprus. He later also established the \"Service for the Reintegration of Displaced Persons\". Iacovou's work for refugees has had an important impact on subsequent developments in Cyprus, including what has been dubbed the Cypriot \"economic miracle\". In this capacity, Iacovou became a close associate of Archbishop Makarios, the first President of the Republic of Cyprus. He also became one of the most articulate advocates of the rights of displaced persons in Cyprus, who form a core issue of the wider Cyprus problem. His work in the field has been nationally and internationally acknowledged, with his exposure to these people's problems influencing his subsequent career. Iacovou is considered one of the ablest administrators of Cyprus and is often referred to as the technocrat with the big heart. From April 1976 until January 1979, he served as Head of the Africa Department of the UN High Commission for Refugees in Geneva.\nFrom January 1979 until January 1983, he was Ambassador of the Cyprus Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany, with parallel accreditation to Austria and Switzerland; later on, he served as Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nOn 22 September 1983, he was appointed Foreign Minister and remained in this post until February 1993. His first appointment to this office came just before the illegal and unilateral declaration of \"independence\" by the Turkish Cypriot leadership in 1983. Nevertheless, he successfully pursued the condemnation of this action in the United Nations Security Council through the adoption of SC Resolutions 541 and 550. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, he negotiated Cyprus's Customs Union Agreement with the then European Economic Community (EEC) in 1987, and in 1990, he submitted the application of Cyprus to join the EEC. In 2003, Iacovou signed the Treaty of Accession of Cyprus to the European Union (\"EU\").\nLater on, he was appointed by the Greek government as President of the National Foundation for the Reception and Resettlement of Repatriated Greeks. His programme for the integration of several hundred thousand persons of Greek origin returning to Greece from the former Soviet Union was met with great success. Iacovou masterminded operation Golden Fleece, the liberation of fifteen hundred men, women and children of Greek origin from the besieged city of Sukhumi in Abkhazia; he later participated in a similar operation in the city of Groznyy, Chechnya. He also founded several university departments for the teaching of the Greek language in countries of the former Soviet Union.\n",

At Cornell, Ialenti taught an interdisciplinary writing seminar called Nuclear Imagination: Technology and Worlds.In 2017, Ialenti became the first anthropologist with a feature article in Physics Today, the flagship publication of the American Institute of Physics. Later that year, Helsingin Sanomat published a front-page human interest story about his anthropological search for insights left behind by an enigmatic nuclear waste expert he called Seppo.In 2018, Ialenti was a Nuclear Security Innovation Network Fellow in the N Square Collaborative, a nuclear threat awareness collective funded by the Carnegie Corporation, the Hewlett Foundation, and the Ploughshares Fund. He also served on the U.S. Membership Committee of Northwestern University's trans-Pacific think-tank Meridian 180.From 2017 to 2019, Ialenti conducted a field study exploring the political, economic, and organizational drivers behind transuranic nuclear weapons waste \"drum breach\" accidents at Idaho National Laboratory and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. He developed this study in collaboration with geologist Allison Macfarlane, the former Chair of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.MIT Press published Ialenti's first book, Deep Time Reckoning, in 2020. It was distributed by Penguin Random House. The book examined Finnish nuclear waste company Posiva's efforts to make reductive, pragmatic models of far future societies, bodies, and ecosystems\u2014and how their efforts were enabled by the Finnish populace's relatively high levels of trust in geotechnical engineers, regulators, and ministry experts.In 2021, Ialenti became the first cultural anthropologist with an article published in the American Nuclear Society's technical journal Nuclear Technology. The article examines Finland's cooperative \"mankala\" nuclear energy LLCs through the lens of legal-anthropological theories of corporate form. Later that year, Ialenti was featured alongside ambient musician Brian Eno in a Headspace meditation podcast about long-term thinking.Ialenti is an Associate of the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco, California.\nIalenti is married to conservationist Allegra Wrocklage.

        "Janis_Ian": {
            "early_life": "Born in Farmingdale, New Jersey, Ian was raised on a farm, and attended East Orange High School in East Orange, New Jersey, and the New York City High School of Music & Art. Both sets of grandparents (from Kyiv, Ukraine; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; and Poland) lived in the New York-New Jersey area, having emigrated via England in about 1918. Her parents, Victor, a music teacher, and Pearl, a college fundraiser, were Jewish-born liberal atheists who ran several summer camps in upstate New York. As a child, Ian admired the work of folk musicians such as Joan Baez and Odetta. Starting with piano lessons at the age of two (at her own insistence), Ian, by the time she entered her teens, was playing the organ, harmonica, French horn and guitar. At the age of 12, she wrote her first song, \"Hair of Spun Gold\", which was subsequently published in the folk publication Broadside and was later recorded for her eponymous debut album. In 1964, she legally changed her name to Janis Ian, taking her brother Eric's middle name as her new surname.\nAt the age of 14, Ian wrote and recorded her first hit single, \"Society's Child (Baby I've Been Thinking)\", about an interracial romance forbidden by a girl's mother and frowned upon by her peers and teachers. Produced by George \"Shadow\" Morton and released three times from 1965 to 1967, \"Society's Child\" became a national hit upon its third release after Leonard Bernstein featured it in a late-April 1967 CBS TV special titled Inside Pop: The Rock Revolution.The song's theme of interracial relationships was considered taboo by some radio stations, who withdrew or banned it from their playlists accordingly. In her 2008 autobiography Society's Child, Ian recalls receiving hate mail and death threats as a response to the song and mentions that a radio station in Atlanta that played it was burned down. In July 1967, \"Society's Child\" reached no. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single sold 600,000 copies and the album sold 350,000 copies.At the age of 16, Ian met comedian Bill Cosby backstage at a Smothers Brothers show where she was promoting \"Society's Child\". Since she was underage, she was accompanied by a chaperone while touring. After her set, Ian had been sleeping with her head on the lap of her chaperone (an older female family friend). According to Ian in a 2015 interview, she was told by her then manager that Cosby had interpreted their interaction as \"lesbian\" and as a result \"had made it his business\" to warn other television shows that Ian wasn't \"suitable family entertainment\" and \"shouldn't be on television\" because of her sexuality, thus attempting to blacklist her. Although Ian would later come out, she states that at the time of the encounter with Cosby she had only been kissed once, by a boy she had a crush on, in broad daylight at summer camp.Ian relates on her website that, although \"Society's Child\" was originally intended for Atlantic Records and the label paid for her recording session, Atlantic subsequently returned the master to her and quietly refused to release it. Ian relates that years later, Atlantic's president at the time, Jerry Wexler, publicly apologized to her for this. The single and Ian's 1967 debut album (which reached no. 29 on the charts) were finally released on Verve Forecast. In 2001, \"Society's Child\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, which honors recordings considered timeless and important to music history. Her first four albums were released on a double CD entitled Society's Child: The Verve Recordings in 1995.\n\n\"Society's Child\" stigmatized Ian as a one-hit wonder until her most successful US single, \"At Seventeen\", was released in 1975. \"At Seventeen\" is a bittersweet commentary on adolescent cruelty, the illusion of popularity and teenage angst, from the perspective of a narrator looking back on her earlier experience. The song was a major hit as it charted at no. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, hit number one on the Adult Contemporary chart and won the 1976 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Female, beating out Linda Ronstadt, Olivia Newton-John and Helen Reddy. Ian appeared as the first musical guest on the series premiere of Saturday Night Live on October 11, 1975, performing \"At Seventeen\" and \"In the Winter\". The album Between the Lines was also a smash and reached number one on Billboard\u2032s album chart. The album would be certified platinum for sales of over one million copies sold in the US. Another measure of her success is anecdotal: on Valentine's Day 1977, Ian received 461 valentine cards, having indicated in the lyrics to \"At Seventeen\" that she never received one as a teenager.\"Fly Too High\" (1979), produced by disco producer Giorgio Moroder, was Ian's contribution to the soundtrack of the Jodie Foster film Foxes and was also featured on Ian's 1979 album Night Rains. It also became another international hit, reaching number one in many countries, including South Africa, Belgium, Australia, Israel and the Netherlands, and going gold or platinum in those countries and others. Another country where Ian has achieved a high level of popularity is Japan: Ian had two Top 10 singles on the Japanese Oricon charts, \"Love Is Blind\" in 1976 and \"You Are Love\" in 1980. Ian's 1976 album Aftertones also topped Oricon's album chart in October 1976. \"You Are Love (Toujours Gai Mon Cher)\" is the theme song of Kinji Fukasaku's 1980 movie Virus. Ian cut several other singles specifically for the Japanese market, including 1998's \"The Last Great Place\".\nIn the US, Ian did not chart in the Top 40 on the pop charts after \"At Seventeen\", though she had several songs reach the Adult Contemporary singles chart through 1980 (all failing to make the Top 20).\nIan started Rude Girl Records, Inc., and its publishing arm, Rude Girl Publishing, on January 2, 1992. Since then, RGR has steadily grown, with its ownership of more than twenty-five Janis Ian albums and DVDs overseas, as well as hundreds of unreleased recordings and videos, including unreleased songs, concerts, demos, and rehearsal tapes. The Rude Girl label oversees the production of Ian's newer work, and in the case of older work, its re-mastering and the re-creation of the original artwork.From 1982\u201392, Ian continued to write songs, often in collaboration with then songwriting partner Kye Fleming, some of which have been covered by Amy Grant, Bette Midler, Marti Jones and other artists. She released Breaking Silence in 1993 and also came out as a lesbian.Other artists have recorded Ian's compositions, including Roberta Flack, who had a hit in 1973 with Ian's song \"Jesse\", which peaked at #19 on the Billboard pop charts on November 3, 1973. Ian's own version is included on her 1974 album Stars (the title song of which has also been oft-covered, including versions by Joan Baez, Shirley Bassey, Cher, Nina Simone and Barbara Cook). \"At Seventeen\" is Ian's most covered composition with 50 versions by artists including Celine Dion, Miki Howard and Julia Fordham. Ian's song \"In The Winter\" has also been covered many times by singers including Dusty Springfield and Sheena Easton. Richard Barone recorded Ian's song \"Sweet Misery\" on his album Sorrows & Promises: Greenwich Village in the 1960s in 2016. She continues to tour worldwide, though she stated that her 2022 North-American tour which was cancelled when a laryngitis diagnosis became severe would be her \"last full tour\".In August 2018 Ian performed at the UK's Cambridge Folk Festival.\nIan's mother Pearl Yadoff Fink was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1975. Because of this, Ian and her brother persuaded their mother to pursue her lifelong dream of going to college. Fink eventually enrolled in Goddard College's adult education program and ultimately graduated with a master's degree. After Fink's death in 1997, Ian decided to auction off memorabilia to raise money to endow a scholarship at Goddard specifically for older continuing education students, which became the Pearl Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity. At the end of each year, 90% or more of funds raised from sale of merchandise, donations from fans and contributions from Ian herself are disbursed to various educational institutions to fund scholarships. By 2020, it had endowed more than $1,250,000 in scholarship funds at four schools.Ian married Portuguese filmmaker Tino Sargo in 1978 and the two divorced in 1983. Accusations of Sargo's physical and emotional abuse were discussed in Ian's autobiography. After moving to Nashville, she met Patricia Snyder in 1989. Ian came out as a lesbian in 1993 with the worldwide release of her album Breaking Silence. Snyder and Ian married in Toronto on August 27, 2003. Ian has a stepdaughter and two grandchildren with Snyder.\n",

Ian attended Bayside High School, with classmates (and future Anthrax bandmates) Dan Lilker and Neil Turbin. Witnessing KISS live at Madison Square Garden in 1977 made a huge impact on Ian, who has been vocal about his love for the band (Ian appeared on an episode of Gene Simmons Family Jewels, in which he visited Simmons' home and spoke about the impact KISS has had on his life). Ian went on to be influenced by British heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Mot\u00f6rhead and Judas Priest, as well as the punk rock band Ramones. The musical style of his playing and songwriting including fast alternate picking was also largely influenced by the German metal band Accept.\nIan states that Malcolm Young, Rudolf Schenker, and Johnny Ramone were his biggest influences to pursue rhythm guitar.\nIan was formerly married to his high school girlfriend, Marge Ginsburg, in the 1980s; the marriage ended in divorce.In 2011, he married singer Pearl Aday, adopted daughter of singer Meat Loaf.

            "early_life": "J-Swift was born Juan Manuel Martinez-Luis in 1971 in Madrid, Spain. His Afro-Cuban father, Pedro, was a salsa bandleader and multi-instrumentalist. His mother, Dolores, was a native of the Canary Islands. In 1974, the family headed to Los Angeles, California, settling in Inglewood. At age six, J-Swift enrolled in a piano conservatory, quickly proving to be a prodigy. The all-rap radio station KDAY introduced him to hip-hop in the early 1980s, and the first record he ever got was by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.\nAround 1988, J-Swift attended Locke High School, where he met his mentor R&B musician Reggie Andrews, producer of Dazz Band's 1982 funk hit \"Let It Whip\" and collaborator of Rick James. After J-Swift composed three new jack swing-style songs to get his attention, Andrews suggested that he concentrate on writing and producing, and set him up with a recording studio (complete with a then-state-of-the-art Akai MPC60) at South Central Unit (SCU), an after-school program for disadvantaged young talent. This gave J the opportunity to submit songs to A&M Records' Rondor Music publishing, while additional work came via BMI's Cheryl Dickerson. Though much of this early music went unreleased (like an album by Bell Biv DeVoe spin-off STR8-Ahead), J-Swift's official songwriting/producing debut came in 1991 with Keisha Jackson's \"Feel You Out.\"\nAround this time J-Swift began making music with a crew of dancers-turned-rappers. With Reggie Andrews' record collection at their disposal, J-Swift and The Pharcyde crafted a three-song demo in '91 and subsequently a hip-hop classic, 1992's Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde. Featuring the hit single Passin' Me By, Pharcyde's debut went certified Gold. Disputes over production and credits caused a rift between J and the group (although they would later reunite on The Pharcyde's \"Trust\" remix in 2000, not to mention several J-Swift-produced tracks on Fatlip's 2005 solo debut The Loneliest Punk, and Fatlip and Tre Hardson's 2007 holiday song \"All I Want for Xmas\").\nWith his own \"Fat House Productions\" acts Jazzyfatnastees and Quinton, J-Swift signed an ill-fated million dollar deal with Tommy Boy Records in 1993. Another of his groups, The Wascals, dropped several singles including \"Class Clown\" and \"The Dips\" in '94, but broke up before releasing their debut. The crew was started by members Alfie and Buckwheed, the latter of which met J-Swift while they were going to high school together. (Wascals' Greatest Hits, completely produced by J-Swift, was finally released by Delicious Vinyl in 2007.) In the mid-'90s, J-Swift lent his signature style to a string of remixes, including Prince's \"Letitgo (Sherm Stick Edit),\" Massive Attack's \"Protection,\" and Urban Thermo Dynamics' \"Manifest Destiny\" (featuring a young Mos Def).\nJ-Swift was the subject of the 2007 documentary film 1 More Hit.J-Swift recorded new tracks from 2005 through 2010, providing not only the beats but also the rhymes. Featuring soul-baring rap confessionals (\"Off My Chest\") and tales of perseverance through struggles (\"Born To Win Despite Myself\") \u2014 while still celebrating recreational drug use (\"I'll Do Mine\") \u2014 J-Swift's new project began with an alter ego Negro Kanevil.\nIn 2006, J-Swift was arrested for possession of narcotics. In 2015, his permanent resident status was stripped and he was deported back to his birth country of Spain.\n",

In the fourth live-show episode of the show, Reynoso was put against Janice Javier, with Reynoso losing to Javier when the scores of the coaches and the audience was added up. In 2014, Reynoso was signed to apl.de.ap's label, BMBX.In 2018, Reynoso (now going under her stage name J. Rey Soul) collaborated with apl.de.ap's group Black Eyed Peas on their album Masters of the Sun Vol. 1, after previous singer Fergie departed from the group.

At a young age he was introduced by his parents to music like old-school hip hop and reggaeton, and would make rudimentary beats on a miniature keyboard. In school, English was his favorite subject and he would write short stories. He began writing raps and freestyling with his brothers in middle school, influenced by New York City rappers like Biggie, Nas, DMX, Jay-Z and Big Pun.\nIn 2016 he appeared on the second season of The Rap Game, a reality show competition hosted by Jermaine Dupri on Lifetime. The then fifteen-year-old secured his place on the show after Dupri found his freestyles on Instagram. In one of the challenges, Rivera placed in first, earning a spot on the cover of Hip Hop Weekly magazine. Although he did not win the overall competition, his impressive performance gained him a substantial following, and he released his debut single \"No Static\" soon thereafter. By the end of the year he had received more than 500,000 views on his YouTube channel.He released his first project in 2017, a three-track extended play called Barely Famous. After his clout from the show died down, he went through a period where he admits he lost his motivation and stopped focusing on his music. He blew all of his money from The Rap Game on marijuana and was considering a job in construction. After getting kicked out of his mom's house he made the decision to give music one last try and connected with his future manager Gabi Acevedo to restart his career.In October 2019 he released his mixtape Hood Life Krisis, Vol. 1, which included his breakout single \"Need Me\", a \"melodic, punch-line laden\" track sampling the 2000 song \"Best of Me, Part 2\" by M\u00fda featuring Jay-Z. In November, with the song at over 3 million streams on Spotify, it was announced he had signed a deal with Interscope Records via G*Starr Entertainment. He also put out his fifth and final music video for the album, this time for \"Love Won't Change\". As of 2022, \"Need Me\" remains his most-viewed with over 115 million YouTube views.\nHe released Hood Life Krisis, Vol. 2 that December and embarked on his first headlining national tour the following month. Holding the final shows in his hometown of New York, he became the first artist in history to sell out the legendary SOB's venue on three consecutive nights. Notably, in April, Drake paid him homage by playing and singing along to his songs \"Used To\" and \"On Me\" during an Instagram Live session with OVO Mark. A week later he released a new single, \"Proud of Me\", along with an accompanying music video. After appearing on Lil Tjay's State of Emergency EP, he further collaborated with him in June on the single \"Hood Scars 2\", which served as a followup to J.I.'s original song which had by then amassed 15 million streams across all platforms.In July 2020 he came out with the single \"Spanglish\" with Puerto Rican rapper Myke Towers, with both artists mixing English and Spanish in their verses. It served as the lead single to his next EP, Welcome to GStarr Vol. 1, which he released on July 17 and also featured Lil Durk. In the first 20 minutes, it garnered 1.3 million streams on Spotify. A few days prior, Spotify announced a partnership with J.I. as a part of its recently launched RADAR program meant to promote \"world-class talent through [their] global marketing and editorial teams\" with placement in their official playlists, a mini-documentary, third-party partnerships, a Spotify Singles recording and support on the EP release.On November 30, 2020, his single \"Need Me\" was certified gold by the RIAA, his first career plaque.On December 18, 2020, J.I released Hood Life Krisis, Vol. 3, the third installment in his Hood Life Krisis series.

            "early_life": "Hailey was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, to Anita and Cliff Hailey both of whom were gospel singers. For a time, the Hailey family lived in Baltimore where they performed gospel music. The family later returned to Charlotte when Cedric was a teen. He attended Garinger High School.\nAlong with younger brother, Joel (known professionally as \"JoJo\") and his father, Hailey recorded three gospel albums as \"Little Cedric and the Hailey Singers\" beginning with the 1983 release I'm Alright Now by Atlanta International Records, Gospel. Though the album failed to place on any Billboard magazine charts, the next two releases, 1984's Jesus Saves and God's Blessing in 1985, both placed upon the Billboard Gospel Albums chart; the former at No. 4 and the latter at No. 22.Cedric and Joel's gospel singing eventually connected them with the DeGrate brothers, Donald \"DeVante Swing\" DeGrate and Dalvin DeGrate, with whom they formed the R&B group Jodeci. As lead vocalist for the group, Hailey and Jodeci would release three multi-platinum albums between 1991 and 1995. In 1996, the group announced a hiatus from recording and releasing music. Hailey continued to record with his brother as the duo K-Ci & JoJo, releasing five albums between 1997 and 2013.\nAs K-Ci, his cover of Bobby Womack's \"If You Think You're Lonely Now\" was featured on the soundtrack to the 1994 film, Jason's Lyric. It was released as a single and peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100.\nHailey dated fellow R&B singer and then label-mate Mary J. Blige from 1992 to 1997. Blige stated that they were engaged, but Hailey denied that they were going to get married.The two Hailey brothers are cousins of R&B singers Fantasia Barrino, Dave Hollister, Calvin Richardson, and Stephanie Mills.He is married to Cassandra Hailey.\n",

            "early_life": "Born in Toronto to a Jamaican father and an Afro-Guyanese mother, Sandra McKenzie, K-Cut's family moved to Queens, New York City, when he was a child. He and his brother Sir Scratch (Shawn McKenzie) were both DJs and attended John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens, where K-Cut met future group member Large Professor. His mother was very supportive of her sons' aspiring hip hop careers, funding their studio time and becoming the manager of their group Main Source. K-Cut is the cousin of fellow producer Rashad Smith, as well as musician Eddy Grant. His maternal grandfather was a Toronto-based soul/disco singer in the 1970s.\nIn 1989, Main Source released their first independent 12\" single, \"Think\" b/w \"Atom\", under the mentorship of producer/engineer Paul C. On July 17, 1989, Paul C was murdered in his home; K-Cut later stated that Main Source \"basically inherited Paul C's style\" and strove to \"carry the torch\" of his sound going forward. During this period, K-Cut helped teach DJ Premier sampling techniques on the E-mu SP-1200. After self-releasing their second 12\" single \"Watch Roger Do His Thing\" in 1990, the group signed to Wild Pitch Records.In 1991, the group released their debut album, Breaking Atoms, which is regarded as one of the  greatest hip hop albums of all time. Although Large Professor produced the majority of the album, K-Cut was praised for his \"creative, energetic scratching\", particularly on the track \"Peace Is Not the Word to Play\", which he produced. Also that year, K-Cut's production appeared on Queen Latifah's album Nature of a Sista', and he produced the bulk of The Black Tie Affair, an album by Toronto rapper Maestro Fresh Wes, which was certified gold in Canada.The following year, K-Cut produced the Main Source single \"Fakin' the Funk\", which appeared on the White Men Can't Rap soundtrack and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Singles chart. In 1993, he produced the Fu-Schnickens single \"What's Up Doc? (Can We Rock)\", featuring Shaquille O'Neal, which peaked at number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified gold in the United States. That year, Large Professor left Main Source due to business differences, with K-Cut taking over as the main producer for their 1994 album Fuck What You Think. The album's single, \"What You Need\", was sampled for Madonna's 1995 worldwide hit \"Human Nature\", which credits K-Cut as a songwriter.By the late 1990s, K-Cut moved back to Toronto, further contributing his production to the city's hip hop scene. In 1997, he produced the Infinite single \"Gotta Get Mine\" (featuring Divine Brown) and contributed to Citizen Kane's EP The Epic, both of which were nominated for a Juno Award for Best Rap Recording. He also produced two tracks for Choclair's 1999 debut Ice Cold, which won the aforementioned Juno Award.In the early 2000s, K-Cut mentored a young Toronto producer named Watts.As of 2016, he served as the touring DJ for Canadian singer Kiki Rowe.\n",

His passion for music, in particular Hip Hop, R&B and reggae forms the single most important driving force in his life. From then he rose to an incredibly high standard in the growing post civil war music industry of Sierra Leone while still in Secondary School.\nIn 2004, K-Man, along with fellow Sierra Leonean youth Underground rappers C-Jay and Camouflag, formed the Freetown based Hip Hop group called Conscious Knowledge, more commonly known as CK.

While in Guinea, K-Man worked with several prominent Guinean rappers including Bill De Sam and Sierra Leonean born in Guinea reggae musician Daddi Cool.\nWith enough time at his disposal, the Mandingo young star K-Man decided to go solo. This would mean doing all eight tracks in his debut album \"watch u back\" alone.

His father was a minister at two congregations in the Greater Toronto Area. k-os moved along with his family to Trinidad while he was in grade three. In Trinidad, k-os surrounded himself with music to deal with being away from Canada. He returned to Canada with his mother in his teen years, taking up residence in Whitby, Ontario, a town east of Toronto, while attending Anderson Collegiate Vocational Institute. His father temporarily stayed behind in Trinidad to continue his work. His father worked as a computer engineer and became Director of Communications for BWIA, the national Trinidadian airline, while his mother owned a cosmetics company.\nGrowing up, k-os was a fan of artists and groups as diverse as New Order, Depeche Mode, Rx Bandits, Michael Jackson, Boogie Down Productions, Slick Rick, A Tribe Called Quest, and The Beatles. He said that he was \"insecure\" in high school and he pursued his musical ambitions because after performing at an assembly in his high school gym he realized performing attracted people towards him and it made him feel \"powerful and ... secure\". In 1992, he attended Carleton University in Ottawa for one semester to please his father. He returned to Toronto and enrolled into York University. Being friends with Nigel Williams, a member of the band Pocket Dwellers, Nigel encouraged k-os to continue to develop his musical abilities when he was confronted with \"difficult forays\".\nWhile attending York University, k-os gained his first exposure in the music industry in 1995 when he released the single \"Musical Essence\" with a music video financed by a VideoFACT grant. He dropped out of the university shortly afterwards. The single was produced with friends Clarence Gruff and Kevin Risto; currently, Risto is one half of the production duo known as Midi Mafia (produced the 50 Cent single \"21 Questions\"). After winning a MuchMusic Video Award for the single, k-os was noticed by NBA player John Salley, who became his manager. With the single gaining moderate success, k-os was invited to perform in the 1995 Hip-Hop Explosion Tour, with other Canadian acts such as Rascalz and Ghetto Concept. Salley and Raphael Saadiq began work with k-os on his planned debut Missing Links, eventually releasing his second single \"Rise Like the Sun\" in 1996. k-os suddenly withdrew from the music industry in 1996 after receiving an offer from BMG. k-os would later say that during this time he had already completed several albums but was dissatisfied with his music. He described his music as \"pretentious and derivative,\" and stated at the time that he was \"still trying to figure out who he was.\"He continued to live with his manager Salley in Los Angeles. Soon after, Red1 of the Rascalz, whom k-os befriended at the 1995 Explosion Tour, invited him to move to Vancouver, British Columbia. There he contributed a verse and chorus lines to the Rascalz' Global Warning album, released in 1999. He had also been invited to contribute to Rascalz' groundbreaking single \"Northern Touch\", but was unable to participate due to other commitments. k-os returned to the music scene by performing at the North by Northeast music festival in 1999. He took stage with the Vancouver band Namedropper.Inspired by Michael Jackson, A Tribe Called Quest, The Beatles, The Roots and Stevie Wonder, k-os worked on a new debut album. He described his new musical focus on \"doing stuff really obscure and making music for myself.\"\nHe recorded a demo tape and began looking for a record company to sign with, eventually settling on Capitol Records. Later, the parent company EMI transferred his record deal to another label, Astralwerks, co-owned by Virgin Records, after some management and scheduling issues.\nAfter the transfer k-os was added to the roster of the Toronto-based artist management firm Chris Smith Management.\n",

Kaabi-Linke was raised between Kyiv and Tunis. She moved to Dubai when she was 12 when her father took a job there. Kaabi-Linke recalled the move as difficult, particularly in losing the opportunity to study modern dance. With her mother's encouragement, Kaabi-Linke began to draw. Later she studied painting at the Tunis Institute of Fine Arts, graduated in 1999, and received her Ph.D. from the Sorbonne in 2008 in aesthetics and the philosophy of art. While in France, she met her German husband, Timo, who would later curate many of Kaabi-Linke's shows.\n\nThe artist held her first solo show in Tunis in 2009, and subsequent solo shows in Berlin (2010), the Mosaic Rooms of Earl's Court (London, 2014), and the Dallas Contemporary (2015). Kaabi-Linke received the 2009 Alexandria Biennale's Jury Prize and the 2011 Abraaj Group Art Prize. The latter commissioned her 2011 Flying Carpets, which was shown at the 54th Venice Biennale and later purchased by and exhibited at the New York Guggenheim Museum in 2016. Kaabi-Linke held a residency at the London Delfina Foundation in 2012, where she was inspired after meeting survivors of domestic violence. She won the Discoveries Prize for emerging art at the 2014 Art Basel Hong Kong, where she exhibited with the Kolkatan Experimenter gallery. One of the judges juxtaposed the social content of her work against the political reservations of other exhibitions in the show. Earlier that year, she completed her Meinstein (\"My Stone\") project in the center of Neuk\u00f6lln, a borough of Berlin. Her pavement mosaic uses stones that correspond to the national origins of the borough's residents, which is a largely immigrant population.

He studied under professors Marwan Kassab-Bachi and Rebecca Horn.\nKaaf is influenced by European and Arab cultures and art traditions. His abstract art is inspired by important locations in his life\u2014Damascus, Beirut, and Berlin\u2014and concepts such as Sufi mysticism and Islamic philosophy. Balance between meditation and returning to everyday life is part of the artist\u2019s thinking and is directly inscribed in his artistic activity.Kaaf\u2019s work comprises various artistic disciplines, from drawing and photography through glass sculpture, sound, and video to room installation. He primarily works with paper and ink.\nHe finds his European role models in Classical Modernism and the avant-garde of the 1960s: works like his series The Byzantine Corner were inspired by Henri Matisse\u2019s paper cutouts and the collages of the Dadaists. Influences from his delving into the German art movement ZERO are recognizable. The principle of removal and readdition is characteristic of his working method. The works display their form language in relation to point and line, surface and depth, black and white, surfaces and forms, rhythm, fire, erosion, and light and shadow. Kaaf\u2019s abstractions are the result of his intense dealings with script, architecture, and history.\nKaaf\u2019s works engage in dialogue with cultures and disciplines and, beyond them, through interdisciplinary collaborations, to Gesamtkunstwerke, syntheses of the arts. Examples include a 2018 video installation on 48 Variations for Two Pianos by John McGuire (Festival ME_MMIX 2018) in the Es Baluard Museum for Modern and Contemporary Art in Palma; in 2015, Intima, a dance project in collaboration with Dawson Dance SF and the choreographer David Dawson, San Francisco, and the composers Ashraf Kateb and Kinan Azmeh; and his recurrent collaboration since 2011 with the glassblower James Mongrain in Seattle; the products are flowing sculptural forms cooled to glass with titles like Helmet, Tattoo, and Larynx (2014), which correspond with his works on paper (Rift, Dress, Wall, and Burn Trace).\nKaaf presents his work in artist talks, lectures, and workshops, at institutions like Montana State University Billings and at the symposium on Syria and Yemen: making art today with Anna Wallace-Thompson, Buthayna Ali, Fadi Yazigi, and Kevork Mourad in the British Museum in London in 2019. The Artist in Residence Program of Germany\u2019s Foreign Ministry in cooperation with the Regional Association of Berlin Galleries, awarded to Kaaf in 2020, is the first in-house residence program of a German ministry. It is open to selected artists who come from abroad or whose work focuses intensely on the world outside Germany.\nKaaf\u2019s works are found in private and public collections all over the world, for example in the Darat Al Funun \u2013 The Khalid Shoman Foundation in Amman, in the Solidere Collection Beirut, in the MAXXI, the Italian National Museum for Art of the 21st Century (Museo nazionale delle arti del XXI secolo) in Rome, the Moontower Foundation in Bad K\u00f6nig, the Museum for Islamic Art in Berlin, and the Peter Raue collection in Berlin.\n",

You could go to any house and everybody was playing music.\" At fourteen, he began performing professionally with his mother, Tina, and his uncle, the rarely recorded slack-key master Fred Punahoa.\nHis professional breakthrough came a few years later, when he was a part of the Hui 'Ohana (means \"Family Group\"), with his twin brother, Nedward Kaapana, and his cousin, falsetto-great Dennis Pavao. Hui 'Ohana released fourteen albums, each of which was a commercial and critical success.  Kaapana left the group eventually, and then released six albums as the leader of another trio, I Kona, and performed with the Pahinui Brothers, Aunty Genoa Keawe, David Chun, Barney Isaacs, and Uncle Joe Keawe.\nHis first solo album, Lima Wela (means \"Hot Hands\"), was released in 1983; the album won the Na Hoku Hanohano (means \"Honored Stars\") Award for \"Instrumental Album of the Year\" in 1984. He released Simply Slack Key in 1988, and Led Live in 1994 on Dancing Cat Records. He has performed and recorded with acoustic lap-steel player Bob Brozman, and released several more albums on the Dancing Cat label from the late 1990s onward. One of the greatest living slack key masters, Ledward has deep roots in the older styles, using only index finger and thumb picks to combine traditional musical phrases, some modern influences, and spontaneous improvisation to create beautiful multipart arrangements that are simultaneously old and new.\nNashville great Chet Atkins was so impressed by Ledward's playing that he paid him the ultimate country music compliment by giving Ledward his guitar. Ledward has played at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C., and made many tours of North America; his fans frequently refer to themselves as \"Led Heads.\"\nKaapana (\"Kah-ah-pah-nah\") spells his name without using the modern  \u02bbokina  marking that is used to indicate a glottal stop for the proper pronunciation of certain Hawaiian words. Kaapana has said that his family has always spelled it without an \u02bbokina and he prefers the traditional spelling (not Ka\u02bbapana.)\n",

            "early_life": "Kaat was the youngest of four children born to John and Nancy (Bosma) Kaat. He attended the schools of Zeeland, Michigan and is a 1956 graduate of Zeeland High School. During his high school years, he excelled at basketball and baseball.\nKaat attended Hope College in Holland, Michigan, and pitched for the school's Flying Dutchmen baseball team, before being signed by the Washington Senators as an amateur free agent in 1957. Kaat spent all of 1957 and 1958 in the minor leagues before breaking into the majors in 1959. After pitching in 16 games spread out over the next two seasons, Kaat became a permanent member of the pitching staff when the team moved west in 1961 to become the Minnesota Twins. On July 24, 1963 Kaat threw a complete-game shutout and hit a home run for a 5\u20130 Twins win over the Indians. Minnesota pitchers have only homered in the same game in which they threw a shutout three times, and Kaat did so twice; the second occurrence was on October 1, 1970.On July 23, 1964, he gave up two home runs to Bert Campaneris, who was making his major league debut in the game. Kaat was a member of the 1965 Twins team that won the American League pennant. He started three games in the 1965 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, matching up with Sandy Koufax on all three occasions, including a complete game victory in Game 2.\nHis best season was in 1966, when he led the league with 25 wins and 19 complete games. He finished fifth in the MVP voting and was named the American League Pitcher of the Year by The Sporting News. The National League's Sandy Koufax won the Cy Young Award by a unanimous vote; it was the last year in which only one award was given for all of Major League Baseball. Although his 1967 season was somewhat of a let down compared to 1966 (he finished 16\u201313 with a 3.04 ERA), he went on a tear in September and nearly pitched the Twins to another World Series appearance \u2014 cruising to a 7\u20130 record with a 1.51 ERA and 65 strikeouts in 652\u20443 innings pitched. However Kaat sustained a season-ending arm injury in the third inning of the second-to-last game of the season and the Boston Red Sox swept the final two games to win the American League pennant.\nIn 1974, he would set a record for largest gap between 20-win seasons at eight, a mark not surpassed until David Cone broke the mark in 1998. Kaat recorded his third 20-win season in 1975, when he pitched to a 20\u201314 record with a 3.11 ERA. This was also the only year of his career in which he received votes for the Cy Young Award, finishing fourth. Although Kaat would pitch a few games a year out of the bullpen over the course of his career, he was primarily a starting pitcher until 1979, when he became a relief pitcher in a season which he split between the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Yankees. He had been traded with Mike Buskey from the Chicago White Sox to the Phillies for Dick Ruthven, Alan Bannister and Roy Thomas on December 10, 1975. With the St. Louis Cardinals in 1982, Kaat earned his only World Series ring, working in four games out of the bullpen in the 1982 World Series.\nKaat was an All-Star three times (1962, 1966, 1975), and won the Gold Glove Award for defensive skill a record 16 consecutive times (1962\u20131977). His record for career Gold Gloves by a pitcher is now second to Greg Maddux's 18. Kaat used the same baseball glove for 15 seasons.In 1983, he became the last major league player to have played in the 1950s and the last player for the original Washington Senators to retire. Kaat is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League games in four decades. At the time of his retirement, Kaat's 25-year career was the longest of any pitcher in major league history. He is now third all-time, behind Nolan Ryan's 27 seasons and Tommy John's 26 campaigns. Kaat also set a 20th-century record by playing during the administrations of seven U.S. Presidents \u2013 Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jr., Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan. This mark was equaled by Nolan Ryan when he retired after the 1993 season, the first year of the administration of Bill Clinton.\nAs was stated during the television broadcast of the seventh game of the 1965 World Series, Kaat was a broadcaster on local radio in Minnesota. He also served as an analyst for Home Team Sports during the 1981 baseball strike. Following his stint as pitching coach, he went into sports broadcasting full-time starting out as the chief baseball correspondent for Good Morning America from 1984\u201385.His first full-time broadcasting job was with the Yankees was during the 1986 season, where he called around 100 games for WPIX. He only lasted one season as the Yankees replaced him with Billy Martin, who was between managing stints and who was purposely brought in to second-guess Lou Piniella. In between broadcasting stints for the Yankees, he spent six years (1988\u20131993) as an announcer for the Twins.In 1986, Kaat was the backup announcer for NBC Sports' coverage of baseball with Phil Stone (for the April 19 Minnesota\u2013California contest) and Jay Randolph (the July 14 Cincinnati\u2013Atlanta contest). In 1988, he covered the College World Series and the MLB playoffs and World Series for ESPN and also served as an analyst for NBC's coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics.\nKaat's marriages to his first wife, Julie, and his second wife, Linda, ended in divorce. His third wife, MaryAnn, died in July 2008 after 22 years of marriage. Kaat created a memorial fund in her name to put lights on the baseball fields in his hometown of Zeeland, Michigan, in her honor. Kaat and MaryAnn have four children and six grandchildren. Kaat married his fourth wife, Margie, in 2009.\nSee also  List of Major League Baseball players who played in four decades\nList of Major League Baseball career wins leaders\nList of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders\nList of Major League Baseball career hit batsmen leaders\nList of Major League Baseball career strikeout leaders\nList of Major League Baseball all-time leaders in home runs by pitchers\n",

In the mid 1970s, she began creating more structured compositional works, some of which include electronics and layered voice sounds.She has accumulated a large repertoire of vocal works by 20th- and 21st-century music masters, including many pieces composed especially for her voice.    She has performed and recorded works by composers including John Cage, Robert Ashley, Morton Feldman, Philip Glass, Larry Austin, Peter Gordon, Alvin Lucier, and her husband Morton Subotnick, and has collaborated with choreographer Merce Cunningham, and poet Kenneth Goldsmith.

            "early_life": "Ortiz has created graffiti art since at the age of ten. Starting in the mid-1970s, he tagged in New York's Lower East Side under the moniker LA2. At the age of thirteen, his subway tags caught the attention of Keith Haring in 1980. Haring was reportedly inspired by Ortiz's artistry and the two began collaborating. At the age of sixteen, Ortiz was in contact with Basquiat and Andy Warhol. In 1982, Ortiz and Haring collaborated for an exhibition at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York.In a 1992 biography on Haring's life, Haring stated \"We just immediately hit it off. It's as if we'd known each other all our lives. He's like my little brother.\" Kenny Scharf, artist and friend of Haring's, recalled \"Keith treated him as a true collaborator; he didn't treat him like some little kid, which he actually was, really. He respected him and gave him half of whatever they collaborated on.\" Ortiz confirmed that he was paid for his work during Haring's lifetime. However, Ortiz stopped receiving payment from Haring's estate following his death. According to scholar Ricardo Montez, the Haring Foundation has \"since made strides to rectify LA2's erasure.\"Although his collaborator Haring began to be shown in galleries, Ortiz did not receive comparable success. By the early 1990s, Ortiz's contributions were largely forgotten and ignored. He became addicted to heroin and served eight months in prison for possession. Between 1987 and 2002 Ortiz was arrested at least nine times. In 2003, he was arrested for marijuana possession.In 2008, Ortiz and Clayton Patterson added black lines to a Haring mural that was re-created at the intersection of Houston and Bowery streets in order to draw attention to the erasure that Ortiz has faced from Haring's artistic career. Ortiz stated, \"when I was painting that mural, I didn't feel like it was me, I felt like it was Keith's spirit in me [...] I don't want to be rich and famous. What keeps me going is my art. I wanted to show the foundation: This is LA II, this is how it all started.\" In an interview, Ortiz relayed to The New York Sun that \"the executive director of the Haring Foundation, Julia Gruen, [has] repeatedly asked him to help authenticate Haring works in preparation for sale at auction houses such as Sotheby's while refusing his request for recognition by the foundation.\"In 2011, Ortiz was arrested three times in short succession for tagging his famed LA II and LA ROC monikers throughout the Lower East Side. Ortiz stated his graffiti spree came as a result of his wife's death, who had died earlier that year in January after a liver transplant: \"I used the street as a canvas to express myself. It's an emotional thing that I'm still going through.\" Ortiz was arrested for a third time right before the opening of his show at Dorian Grey Gallery and the show suffered as a result. At the time of his arrest, Ortiz stated \"I shouldn't have done it. I knew sooner or later I was going to get arrested.\" Friend Ramona Lugo stated, \"You know how many times I had arguments with him because he was going to do graffiti? He knew not to do that, [but] he's still got that mentality. That is the mentality of the graffiti artist.\" Ortiz was sentenced to prison at Rikers Island for 45 days for the tagging. Hearing of the sentence, Lugo added \"I'm heartbroken for him because I know he's hurting. He's going though hell in there. He doesn't belong in there. He's a good person.\" After his release, Ortiz stated \"I went there for graffiti and got transformed into a gladiator. They got all the gangs in there: the Bloods, the Latin Kings.\" Ortiz stated that the jail time gave him an opportunity to reflect and gave him new inspiration.\nIn 2020, Clayton Patterson described Ortiz as follows:LA2's struggle and history make him important to me. He was a young Puerto Rican kid who came to me for help. He had joined the Keith Haring circus at 15. Keith had the barking dog and the radiant baby. But it's graphics, not fine art. LA2 created the fill-ins. Those little symbols in Keith's work are LA2's signatures. Keith and LA2 were a collaboration, and people don't talk about their work that way. LA2 was not just the help. The art establishment has shafted him.Patterson credited the erasure of Ortiz to racism in the art world.\n",

She took up the piano at the age of five and gave a piano recital at Carnegie Hall at the age of nine. After leaving New York's High School of Music and Art, she formed a band called Jack Sass, which played top 40 cover versions on the club scene. As the group's reputation grew, La La began introducing more of her own songs into the repertoire before she went to Juilliard to major in composition. In 1981, she was invited to tour with Stacy Lattisaw who opened for the Jacksons on a national tour. Following this, she sang with the group Change, along with Luther Vandross, where her voice was heard on their song \"The Glow of Love\", co-written by her childhood friend from East Elmhurst, Queens, Wayne K. Garfield. She played one of her songs, \"Stone Love\", to another neighborhood friend, Kashif, who recorded it for his debut album in 1983.\nThroughout the 1980s, La La established herself as a songwriter, penning songs for many artists including Lillo Thomas (\"All of You\"), Melba Moore (\"Living for Your Love\" and \"It's Really Love\"), Glenn Jones (\"Show Me\" and \"Stay\"), Giorge Pettus (\"My Night for Love\") and a solo release, \"Into the Night\" which was featured on the Beat Street soundtrack album.Through Kashif, she had a couple of her songs recorded by new Arista signing Whitney Houston (\"You Give Good Love\" and \"Thinking About You\") before signing to the label herself (both Kashif and Houston's label) as an artist. In 1987, she released her debut album La La, including duets with Glenn Jones and Bernard Wright and production by R&B group Full Force. She also duetted with Jermaine Jackson on a cover of Climie Fisher's \"Rise to the Occasion\" for his 1989 album Don't Take It Personal.\nLa La continued to write and produce for major artists including Carl Anderson and the top 10 US R&B hit \"Secret Lady\" for Stephanie Mills. After a move to Motown Records, she released her second (and last to date) solo album La La Means I Love You! in 1991, which included her version of her much-covered R&B classic \"Show Me\" as well as contributions from Rene Moore, Marcus Miller and Lenny White.\n",

From an early age, together with her siblings she performed circus acts in their back yard. When she was 14, she was noticed at the local ballet school by Emilie Altenburg who together with her daughter performed in a circus act advertised as the Florita Sisters. After discussing her intentions with Norma's parents, Altenburg took the child to Copenhagen where she was trained to become a trapeze artist under strict, almost slave-like conditions.\nShe made her debut at Variet\u00e9 Maxim in Randers and received her stage name La Norma when aged 16 she performed at the Scala in Copenhagen. During the German occupation of Denmark, Altenburg took Norma to Norway and then to Sweden where she performed in Circus Altenburg and Circus Scott. After the war, in 1946 together with Altenburg, Norma toured Denmark with Circus Belli. There she met Andr\u00e9 Fox, her husband-to-be, who encouraged her to break away from Altenburg. The couple moved on to France where Norma performed an aerial act suspended from the Eiffel Tower. This led to a contract with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, bringing the couple to the United States. She worked with RBB&B from 1949 to 1951. In 1951, she doubled for Betty Hutton in the film The Greatest Show on Earth. For the next 20 years, she continued to perform in other American circuses. Fellow trapeze artist Tony Steele credits her as his inspiration for joining the circus.After her son Gilbert became paralyzed in a scooter accident, she retired from the circus in 1974. She trained young performers until the mid-1980s. She now lives in Sarasota's circus community, and a \"Ring of Fame\" marker records her achievements.\n",

            "early_life": "M.anifest is the son of Ghanaian lawyer and academician Tsatsu Tsikata and Rev. Dr. Priscilla Naana Nketia, a lawyer and pastor. His maternal grandfather Joseph Hanson Kwabena Nketia was a composer, professor and ethnomusicologist. M.anifest emigrated to the United States in 2001 to attend Macalester College in the twin cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul, where he graduated in 2005 with a Bachelor of Arts in economics.\nM.anifest went to high school at SOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College in Tema. He was the entertainment prefect of his school known as Amet Tsikata. He has had artist residencies and given lectures in St. Lawrence University and the University of Ghana, and spoken to several classes in Hamline University, (his Alma mater) Macalester College, Penumbra Theater's Summer Arts Institute and Ashesi University.\nIn his time in the Twin Cities, M.anifest learnt the nitty-gritty bits of becoming an independent musician. He lent his voice to a Pepsi jingle that played nationally on U.S radio, which earned him royalties to produce and release his first solo album, Manifestations, in 2007. That album earned him the \"Songwriter of the Year\" honors in the City Pages as well as top five albums of the year recognition in the Star Tribune. In 2009 he released a free album, The Birds and the Beats, to raise awareness and funds for the work of a non-profit, Young Entrepreneurs Africa.In 2010, M.anifest linked up with Africa Express and toured France and Spain with them. He caught the attention of Africa Express co-founder Damon Albarn who thereafter invited M.anifest to be a collaborator on Rocket Juice & the Moon the following year. In September 2012, M.anifest joined the Africa Express train touring the United Kingdom. He wrote for The Huffington Post about these experiences.He released his sophomore album Immigrant Chronicles: Coming to America in September 2011, which included the singles \"Suffer\", \"Asa\" and \"Blue (Chale What Dey Happen)\". It marked a decade of his life in the U.S. and the beginning of his transition back to Ghana. In 2012, M.anifest began making major inroads in Africa performing on The Big Brother Africa stage as well at the Channel O Music Video Awards in South Africa. The video for his single \"Makaa Maka\" also got him nominated for Most Gifted Hip-Hop Video at the 2012 Channel O Music Awards and won him Best Hip-Hop Video at the locally-held 4Syte Music Video Awards.M.anifest produced and co-wrote an independence mini Hip-Hopera for Channel O and also performed a piece, at the first-ever Ghana Music Week, detailing the history of Ghanaian music. M.anifest is the co-founder of Giant Steps, an interactive conference for entrepreneurial creatives and creative entrepreneurs. He is also included in the feature-length documentary We Rock Long Distance by filmmaker Justin Schell.\nOn 30 June 2016, M.anifest released a diss track to fellow rapper Sarkodie titled \"god MC\". Sarkodie replied within two days with a diss track of his own called \"Kanta\", which was a Panda cover. M.anifest's god MC went on to win Hip Hop Song of the year in the Ghana Music Award the following year. Two years later on 24 December 2018, the two officially squashed their beef with Sarkodie performing at M.anifest's yearly Manifestivies concert in Accra. On June 18, 2020, the two cemented their friendship with Sarkodie featuring M.anifest on his politically conscious track, Brown Paper Bag. The song was met with mixed reaction, with popular music critic, Gabriel Myers Hansen, bemoaning its lack of dance rhythm.\"Bereft of hooks, the instrumentation of the song is crafted with chords that fend off dance; instead inducing a frightful, contemplative atmosphere complete with doomy humming and the blast of gunshots. Insofar as this facilitates the discussion it hosts, it is fit for purpose. After all, this is not a forum for the fainthearted.\"\n",

            "early_life": "Ma was born in Haigang District in Qinghuangdao, the eldest of four children. In 1985, Ma graduated from a local polytechnic college and entered the municipal water works department, where he worked as a technician in charge of furnace maintenance. He later began taking on administrative roles. In 1997, Ma was named head of the water works division of Beidaihe, a seaside resort popular with leaders of the Communist Party. In 2005, the municipal water works was re-organized into a corporation, which signed a 25-year contract with the city to maintain the water supply. Ma became its vice president in charge of its Beidaihe branch.In November 2010, the operations of the Beidaihe branch of the company was separated from that of Qinhuangdao. In the next year, the state-owned Beidaihe Water Works Corporation was founded with Ma Chaoqun as its chief executive. The company served Beidaihe as well as neighbouring counties. More importantly, the company was charged with providing water to various state and party agencies stationed in the area, including to Communist leaders during their annual summer retreat in Beidaihe. In 2012, Ma was given recognition by the province for his high performance during the summer months, named a \"Model Labourer\" by the city of Qinhuangdao.In January 2014, Ma was reported by people with links to a state-owned company in Beijing as having solicited bribes worth millions of yuan from a local hotel. On February 12, 2014, Ma was detained for a corruption investigation.  His younger brother Ma Zhongqun was detained on the same day, and his younger sister Ma Qingru was arrested a month later. On November 12, 2014, the Hebei provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection (CDI) released findings of its investigation, accusing Ma of embezzlement, bribery, and illegally moving public resources. He was arrested and faced a raft of criminal charges.The Ma case gained notoriety for the astronomical value of alleged bribes.  The Hebei CDI was said to have discovered over 120 million yuan ($19.3 million) worth of cash in Ma's home. Also unearthed was 37 kilograms of gold and 68 real estate certificates of ownership. To carry out Ma's arrest, the police mobilized the city's special operations unit, as Ma was believed to have ties with local organized crime. That Ma, merely a division-level (\u5904\u7ea7) official (i.e., rank equivalent to that of a county governor) had such a large sum stored up in his home shocked the public. Ma's mother Zhang Guiying denied that her son was corrupt, claiming that the assets were the result of years of hard work by her husband who operated a coal mine, asserting that her son was being blackmailed.Chinese media has also reported connections between Ma Chaoqun and his so-called \"godfather\", who was suspected to be a high-level official from Beijing. It has been suggested that the processing of the case has faced interference from the authorities as increasing its scope may have dragged out an 'untouchable tiger'.Ma is married to Zhang Lihuan. They had one son. Ma's name, \"Chaoqun\", means \"soars above the rest.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n",

Her grandfather, Lieutenant General Ma Zhen, was the first mayor of Kunming, Yunnan. Born and raised in New York, she attended Baker Elementary School before graduating from Great Neck North Middle and High Schools. Her father, Dr. William Ma, was a mechanical engineer who later specialized in construction claims and litigation before he retired. Her mother, Sophia (n\u00e9e Doo), was a high school art teacher for 20 years before moving the family to San Francisco to be closer to her parents. Rev William Doo was posted as a minister at the San Francisco Swatow Christian Church in San Francisco's Sunset District. Ma earned a Bachelor of Science degree in accounting from Rochester Institute of Technology, a Master of Science in taxation from Golden Gate University, and a Master of Business Administration from Pepperdine University. She is a CPA and member of the Aspen Institute's 2009 Class of Aspen-Rodel Fellows.\nIn 1993, Ma worked at Ernst & Young, one of the \"big six\" accounting firms at the time. However, seeing few female managers and even fewer female partners during her time with the firm, she decided to start her own accounting practice with an associate.\nIn 1994, Ma was elected president of the Asian Business Association, which led to her first involvement with politics, lobbying San Francisco City Hall and the Sacramento State Capitol for business issues that affected women and minorities. As a result of her work on behalf of the Small Business Association at that same time, she was elected in 1995 as a delegate to the White House Conference on Small Business under President Bill Clinton. Ma's advocacy work in that role helped lead to socially responsible contracting for minorities and women in San Francisco, and produced a report to Congress on the 60 top policy recommendations to help small businesses grow and prosper in the 21st century.\nMa is an active member of the California Society of Certified Public Accountants (CalCPA), Governmental Accounting Standards Advisory Council (GASAC). She was also a Hunt Keane Fellow in 2019, Cohort 6. Additionally, she is a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) and had a small role in the short film My Name Is Moe.Ma was appointed to the Assessment Appeals Board of San Francisco by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1995.

In September 1984 he entered the graduate school of Beijing Iron and Steel Institute (now University of Science and Technology Beijing) and joined the Chinese Communist Party in December 1985. After earning his master's degree in 1986, he was hired by the institute as a faculty member.

The position had been vacant for four months since his predecessor Chen Yixin was transferred to the national government.During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wuhan residents criticized Ma and his subordinate, mayor Zhou Xianwang for their slow response to the epidemic. In an interview with China Central Television on 27 January 2020, Zhou admitted that the city government had failed to promptly disclose information about the outbreak and offered to resign, although he added that \"it's an infectious disease, and relevant information should be released according to the law.

            "early_life": "Ma was born in Bangkok to a Thai Chinese father and a Hong Kong Teochew mother. He has one younger sister. Ma first attended NIST International School, but at the age of 8, his family moved to Hong Kong, where he resumed studying in Quarry Bay School. He then excelled 2 years past his usual studying year group and attended South Island School of Hong Kong. In late 2011, he was discovered by Supachai Srivijit, who then became his manager in the entertainment industry, and Ma returned to Thailand to study in Harrow International School, Bangkok. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree of Arts in Business English and a master\u2019s degree  of Business Administration in Tourism and Hospitality Management from Assumption University. Before Ma decided to be an actor, he thought about being a pro golfer. He won a gold medal in the ISSFHK Golf Pairs Championship 2008 in Hong Kong and many other awards against other schools. In 2008, he auditioned for The Star (season 7), a Thai reality show and singing competition, but didn't pass through the final audition.\nMa made his acting debut at the age of 20 with a lead role in a special period drama Gentlemen of Jutathep Series in 2013. This special series made to celebrate ThaiTV3's 43rd anniversary, which assigned five top producers to each make a period drama about the five Jutathep brothers: Khun Chai Taratorn, Khun Chai Pawornruj, Khun Chai Phuttipat, Khun Chai Rachanon and Khun Chai Ronapee. His main series which is Khun Chai Ronapee is directed by Chatchai Plengpanich and he was acted with Chalida Vijitvongthong as female lead. This period drama is an adaptation from the novel of the same name. Before the drama aired, Ma was harshly criticized by netizen, saying that he lacked the looks and talent but he proved to everyone his talent when the drama aired.\nMa then starred in the short film titled Thai Niyom: Prince Pom in 2014. He plays as Prince Pom. This was his first performance in short film after debuting. On the same year, Ma participated in Give Me 5 Concert alongside Mario Maurer, Sukollawat Kanarot, Nadech Kugimiya and Phupoom Pongpanu. During his concert, he invited Tata Young and Boy Peacemaker as his special guest.\nIn 2015, Ma returned to TV screens, after a two-year absence, with a romance action drama The King's Servant directed by Atthaporn Teemakorn. This story takes place in the era of Rama III, the third king of Siam under the House of Chakri. The story sets around the period when Britain (known as Wilat at that time) enters into a commercial partnership role with Siam. He was paired opposite Peranee Kongthai in the series.In the same year, Ma was cast as a lead role in Just a Man, Not a Magician with Kimberley Anne Woltemas. This drama is a remake of 2001 Samee Ngern Phon, and was produced by Ann Thongprasom and directed by Kritsada Techanilobon.\nIn late 2015, Ma made his movie debut as a lead role alongside South Korean actress Hahm Eun-jung in a sci-fi romance movie Microlove.

            "early_life": "Ma was born in Beijing China, in 1973. After moving from Beijing to Oklahoma, Ma started drawing and painting as an alternative to literature, from which she felt alienated having to speak a second language. Ma received a Bachelor of Arts degree in advertising design from Oklahoma Christian University of Science and Arts. In 1999, she earned a Master of Fine Arts degree at Pratt Institute in New York.\nPost graduation, she worked for eight years as the studio director for artist Cai Guo-Qiang.\nMa's initial practical training in advertising fostered in her \"a production and design aesthetic \u2026 in the sense that she is responsive to the qualities and needs of materials as well as to the demands of place and public,\" while remaining critical of market and client. In 2001, Ma fought with another female Asian artist/designer in the live-wrestling performance Crouching Bitch at Deitch Projects. The combat signified the competition between Ma's own short-lived Dodorama fashion label and her co-combatant's, mocking the concurrent New York Fashion Week where downtown designers rivaled to be the \"best.\"The iconoclastic dimension of Crouching Bitch continued in installations such as Wash Hands, made in Beijing in 2003, and Project Change World: City of Yan'an in 2006, but within a more social and political context. In Wash Hands, formally conforming to the government-led hygiene campaign against SARS, Ma instigated unease by asking viewers to wash hands in the same bowl of water. Seemingly in honor of the once politically significant city Yan'an, Project Change World: City of Yan'an was a public service program to highlight, poke fun, and instigate into the universally mocked Chinglish.Ma continued to deal with social consciousness and psychology. In Self-Comfort, a 2005 installation, a video of a woman masturbating was projected onto an actual bed, presenting a self-guided release from loneliness and tension in daily life. The conventionally ignoble act obtained an ambiguous meaning by reflecting the universal loneliness in society.\nSubsequent works stay highly aware of people's ways of living, with more focus on the spiritual life. The video installation Alms was part of the Singapore Biennale in 2006. The video trilogy was set in three religious sites of distinct beliefs. It featured a hand clasping, revealing and finally losing glass balls. The sound track was composed out of recordings of vocal and instrumental sounds of worship at each site. The project underscored the Biennial's theme of \"Belief\" by drawing connections between sites of three distinctive religions, namely Judaism, Islam and Christianity. More fundamentally, the glass balls symbolized the balance that is being constantly negotiated in spiritual life.Alms is the continuation of Ma's reflection upon religious life since Aeolian Garden at UMOCA in 2005, a work consisting of brass windpipes installed under the medieval bridge of San Francesco in the Tuscan town of Colle di Val d'Elsa, creating an atmospheric soundscape. The bridge, initially built to lead people from daily life to religious refuge, \"can once again serve as a conduit for contemplation and reflection.\" The work remains part of the town's cultural patrimony.\nWhile Alms and Aeolian Garden do call for the coexistence of religions and the peace of mind, the idea of dissonance is another running theme of Ma's early works. The dissonance within social life is subtly allegorized by the use of sound. For the short video Rear Window, Ma documented the nightlife of people living in a large residential complex across the street from her apartment. The video is accompanied by sound tracks composed from the artist's own imagination, which makes the much-desired intimacy a mere projection of one's own psyche. Communication seems unachievable despite the voyeuristic observation. The dissonance continues in the soundscapes created by Aeolian Garden. Mario Cristinati observes that, \"The music \u2026 may be harmonious or dissonant, depending on the particular wind conditions \u2026 It also demonstrates how nature intervenes with our senses \u2026 similar to how spiritual life and daily life collide.\" The soundtrack for Alms combined from sound recorded at three religious sites, is also at times cacophonous, revealing a critical attitude toward tolerance and unity.\n",

            "early_life": "Ma was born in Qingdao, a city in Shandong Province on China's Yellow Sea coast, on 18 August 1953. As a child, he was the pupil of a painter who had been persecuted as a Rightist. After his school education was cut short by the Cultural Revolution, he studied by himself, copying out a Chinese dictionary word by word. At fifteen, he joined a propaganda arts troupe, and was later assigned a job as a watchmender's apprentice. For a few years he worked in a petrochemical plant near Beijing, then in 1979, moved to the capital and became a photojournalist for a magazine published by the All China Federation of Trade Unions. During this time, he joined the 'underground' No Name art group, the Yuanmingyuan poetry group, and the April photographers' group. He held clandestine exhibitions of his paintings in his one-room shack in Nanxiao Lane, which became a meeting point for dissident artists and writers of Beijing. \nIn 1983, his paintings were denounced during the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign, and he was placed in detention. After his release, he resigned from his job and set off on a three-year journey through China, selling his paintings and stories as he went. When he returned to Beijing in 1986, he wrote Stick Out Your Tongue, a novella inspired by his travels through Tibet. Its publication in the official journal People's Literature in February 1987 coincided with a nationwide crackdown on the arts, and the government publicly denounced the work as an example of bourgeois liberalism. All copies of the journal were confiscated and destroyed, and a blanket ban was placed on the future publications of Ma Jian's books.\nJust before this event, Ma Jian had moved to Hong Kong, where speech freedoms are much higher. He wrote Bardo, a novel about two doomed lovers who are reincarnated through Chinese history, and The Nine Crossroads, about a group of sent-down youth who are sent to a remote mountain inhabited by a primitive tribe.\nIn 1989, Ma Jian returned to Beijing and took part in the democracy protests. After the Tiananmen massacre, he remained in the capital and wrote The Noodle Maker, a dark political satire. For the next few years, he travelled back and forth between Hong Kong and China, editing, briefly, the Hong Kong arts magazine, Wen Yi Bao, and setting up the New Era publishing company and the literary journal Trends, which published essays and novels banned in China.\nAfter the Handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, Ma Jian moved to Germany to take up a post teaching Chinese literature at Ruhr University, and to work on Beijing Coma, a novel about the Tiananmen massacre and the decade of political repression and economic growth that followed it. In 1999, he moved to London and wrote Red Dust, a fictionalised account of his journey through China in the 1980s, which won the 2002 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award. He returned to China regularly, and resumed work on Beijing Coma, which was finally published in 2008 and won the 2009 Index on Censorship T.R. Fyvel Book Award and the 2010 Athens Prize for Literature. In 2008\u20132009, he travelled extensively through the remote interior of China to research The Dark Road, a novel that explores the One Child Policy, published by Chatto & Windus and Penguin in 2013.\nIn 2001, he collaborated in founding the Independent Chinese PEN Centre, a branch of PEN International, became its board member in 2003\u20132005 and 2009\u20132011, a member of its Freedom to Write Committee since 2003, and director of its Press & Translation Committee since 2011.\nMa Jian is a vocal critic of China's Communist government. His works explore themes and subjects that are taboo in China. He has continually called for greater freedom of expression and the release of jailed writers and other political prisoners. As a result, his books have been banned in China for the last 25 years, and since the summer of 2011, he has been denied entry into China. Despite the restrictions placed on him, Ma Jian has become a leading Chinese writer, internationally distinguished with his works translated into a great number of languages, including English, French, Spanish, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Catalan, Japanese, Dutch, Hebrew, Romanian, Turkish, Greek, Polish, Korean, Italian and Portuguese.\nIn April 2012, while attending the London Book Fair, Ma used red paint to smear a cross over his face and a copy of his banned book Beijing Coma and called his Chinese publisher a \"mouthpiece of the Chinese communist party\" after being \"manhandled\" while attempting to present the book to the director of the General Administration of Press and Publication and the director of National Copyright Administration, Liu Binjie, at the fair.In November 2018, Ma was a guest at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival. Tai Kwun, the venue for the events, initially cancelled his two talks, because it did not want to \"become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual\", but subsequently reversed course. The incident sparked public outcry in Hong Kong. Many related this with the recent Victor Mallet visa controversy and the cancellation of Badiucao's exhibition, complaining that China was covertly silencing critics in the autonomous territory and curbing her autonomy.He lives in London with his partner and translator, Flora Drew, and their four children.\n",

He is a 32nd-generation descendant of his Hakka clan, which can be traced back to the 10th century.Ho attended Queen's College Hong Kong from 1975 to 1979, after which he went to the United Kingdom, where he enrolled at Chelmer Institute of Higher Education and obtained his bachelor of laws degree in 1984. Ho joined a post-graduate programme at the University of Hong Kong in 1984 and obtained his mandatory practising qualification, the postgraduate certificate in laws (PCLL) in 1986.\nAfter gaining his qualifications he was admitted as a solicitor in Hong Kong in 1988 and similarly admitted in Singapore, and England and Wales in 1995 and 1997. He is the senior partner of a law firm in Hong Kong and a principal representative of a law firm in Guangzhou.  His major practice field is civil litigation, specialising in shareholders' disputes and family disputes. He was appointed a China-Appointed Attesting Officer in 2003.He became the vice-president of the Law Society of Hong Kong in June 2005 and was elected president for a one-year term in May 2011, after which he has served as a council member.In 2017, his legal qualifications in England and Wales, and Singapore was disputed, and the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) was contacted regarding this matter. It was reported that the individual by the name of \"Junius Kwan-Yiu Ho\" does not appear to be on the SRA's records.  The dispute, however, was later clarified, for a member by the name of \"Kwan Yiu Ho\" does appear to be on SRA's records.\nHo first contested a Legislative Council election in 2008, running against Civic Party's Margaret Ng in the Legal functional constituency. He was defeated, receiving 1,286 votes, about 34 percent of the vote.Ho was elected as Chairman of Tuen Mun Rural Committee in 2011, ousting the long-time chairman and most powerful rural leader Lau Wong-fat, chairman of the Heung Yee Kuk. In that capacity, he became an ex officio member of the Tuen Mun District Council. He served as the rural committee chairman until 2015.  He was a candidate in the Legislative Council election in New Territories West in September 2012, where he received 10,805 votes, about two per cent of total vote share and was not elected.Ho was appointed to Lingnan University council by Chief Executive of Hong Kong Leung Chun-ying in October 2015. Students staged a protest against the appointment over fears of political interference in university governance.In the 2015 District Council elections, Junius Ho defeated Albert Ho of the Democratic Party in the latter's long-held Lok Tsui seat in a six-way contest by a narrow margin of 277 votes, as the pro-democracy votes were split between Albert Ho and Cheng Chung-tai of Civic Passion. Ho ran again in the 2016 Legislative Council election for the New Territories West. During the election, Ho's supporters were allegedly involved in the withdrawal of candidacy of Liberal Party candidate Ken Chow Wing-kan.  Chow claimed he had been intimidated after receiving threats made against him. On the following day, Ho identified that some of the threats were made by one of his volunteers that had helped him for about one or two months; but Ho defended him by stating that the volunteer only wanted to be angry for him. Ho was elected with 35,657 votes, winning the last of nine seats in the constituency.\nIn May 2017, pro-democracy lawyer Kevin Yam published an article urging solicitors not to vote for Junius Ho in the election for the governing council of the Law Society of Hong Kong. Ho sued for defamation but failed to be re-elected, securing only 572 of 8,148 votes, coming last. In the 2019 District Council elections, Ho with 2,626 votes lost his seat to his rival Lo Chun-yu who had 1,213 more votes.In December 2021, Hong Kong Free Press reported that Ho's voting power in the 2021 Hong Kong legislative election was approximately 7,215 times more than that of an ordinary citizen, as he was a member of the Election Committee and thus could vote for the 40 Legislative Council members elected by the Election Committee constituency; an individual voter in the Heung Yee Kuk functional constituency; a representative of Ho K.C. & Fong Solicitors & Notaries which was a corporate voter in the Commercial (First) functional constituency; as well as being a regular voter in his geographical constituency, New Territories North.\nHe owns two horses, Alex Flyer (\u5929\u797f) and Hong Kong Bet (\u9752\u5c71\u4e4b\u5bf6) that race at The Hong Kong Jockey Club. The graves of Ho's parents were vandalized during the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests, which is believed to be due to his \nassociation with the Yuen Long attacks, though the identity of the perpetrators remains unknown.On 31 August 2022, Ho tested positive for COVID-19.\n",

Ho quit the party in 2015 to focus on community services as a member of the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL), which was rooted in Sham Shui Po.In the 2015 District Council election, Ho ran in Nam Cheong East and was elected with 1,727 votes, becoming a member of the Sham Shui Po District Council. In the 2016 Legislative Council election, Ho replaced Frederick Fung who lost his District Council seat to run in District Council (Second) for ADPL. Due to his lagging behind in the polls, Ho suspended his campaign in the late stage of the election to maximise the election chances of other pro-democrat candidates.In the March 2018 Kowloon West by-election for the vacancy left by Yau Wai-ching of Youngspiration over the Legislative Council oath taking controversy, Ho ran against veteran Frederick Fung in the intra-party primary election for the candidacy, but later withdrew.  Fung later lost in the pro-democracy primary. Ho and other young ADPL members strongly opposed Fung's intention to run in another Kowloon West by-election, which led to Fung's departure from the party.In the 2020 Legislative Council election, Ho contested in the pro-democracy primaries for the nomination in Kowloon West. Initial results showed Ho came in fifth, which meant he barely lost the nomination to localist camp candidate Frankie Fung. With the paper ballots included, Ho slightly surpassed Fung in the final vote tally, securing a place for ADPL in the general election.On 6 January 2021, Ho was among 53 members of the pro-democratic camp who were arrested under the national security law, specifically its provision regarding alleged subversion. The group stood accused of the organisation of and participation in unofficial primary elections held by the camp in July 2020. Ho was released on bail on 7 January.After he was charged with subversion, together with 47 others, Ho decided to resign as vice-chairman of ADPL on 17 March 2021, and he was replaced by Howard Lee.

Many years later, in 2018, Ho shared in a candid dialogue session about Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding prime minister, for detaining him.

Ho was promoted to Superintendent in 2010, and later in 2013 to Senior Superintendent to handle parallel trading. She was awarded with Meritorious Service Medals (Chinese: \u69ae\u8b7d\u734e\u7ae0) and directly promoted to Assistant Commissioner of Customs and Excise in 2017, skipping the Chief Superintendent rank, and was further promoted to Deputy Commissioner two years later.\n\nOn 21 October 2021, Louise Ho was appointed as the first Commissioner of Customs and Excise, and was inaugurated with the National Emblem of the People's Republic of China after the amendment to National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance was passed. She told reporters after inauguration ceremony that smuggling lobsters from Hong Kong to China will undermine Chinese trade restrictions against Australia, and endanger the national security, hence the customs has intensified the crackdown on so. As the Chinese Government has been claiming the ban on Australian lobsters was over fears of elevated traces of minerals and metals since October 2020, comments from Ho were the first official remarks that suggest the targeting of Australian lobsters was motivated by political interests, not health or contamination fears. Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan, as a result, asked Beijing whether Australia was economically sanctioned. Ho later insisted food security is part of national security, argued that her comments were misinterpreted and the authorities will not tolerate so.\nLouise Ho, who was Assistant Superintendent in Customs Department at that time, met Chief Immigration Officer Erick Tsang at work. The duo got married while Tsang was in posting at Office of the Hong Kong Government in Beijing, and finally registered their marriage in 2007. Tsang and Ho did not go on honeymoon, and had no children because of work.

        "Minfong_Ho": {
            "early_life": "Minfong Ho was born in Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon, Myanmar), to Ho Rih Hwa, a Singaporean economist, diplomat and businessman, and Li Lienfung, a Hunan-born chemist and bilingual writer, who were both of Chinese descent. Ho was raised in Thailand, near Bangkok, enrolled in Tunghai University in Taiwan and subsequently transferred to Cornell University in the United States, where she received her bachelor's degree in economics.\nIt was at Cornell that she first began to write, as a way to combat homesickness. She submitted a short story, titled Sing to the Dawn, to the Council for Interracial Books for Children for its annual short story contest. She won the award for the Asian American Division of unpublished Third World Authors, and was encouraged to expand the story into a novel.\nThis she did, and through the process Ho began to see writing as \"a political expression,\" as she once wrote in Interracial Books for Children Bulletin. She had mistrusted the stories about Thailand, Burma, and China she previously read, for she thought that their mostly idyllic portrayal of lives there misrepresented the Asia that she came to know during her childhood. In Sing to the Dawn, Ho brought her readers into a realistic rural Thailand through the eyes of a young village girl Dawan, whose struggle to convince those around her to allow her to take up a scholarship to study in the city reflected the gender discrimination faced by girls in rural Thailand.\nAfter graduating from Cornell University in 1973, Ho returned to Asia and began working as a journalist for The Straits Times in Singapore. She left two years later for Chiang Mai University in Thailand, where she taught English. The three years she spent in Chiang Mai had a deep impact on her. Together with her students and colleagues, Ho spent several periods living and working in nearby villages, as part of the ongoing student movement to alleviate rural poverty. While the student leaders were preoccupied with organizing the peasants into a political group in their search for democracy, Ho became more aware of the emotional world of the women and children there.\nHowever, on October 6, 1976, Ho witnessed the massacre of student protesters in a military coup d'\u00e9tat which restored military rule in the kingdom. But she did not stay long under such circumstance. After marrying John Value Dennis, Jr., an international agriculture policy person whom she met during her Cornell years, Ho left for her alma mater again, where she completed a Master's course in creative writing while working as an English literature teaching assistant. She had also spent some time in relief work along the Thai-Cambodian border in 1980.\nIn 1986, Ho gave birth to her first child, a son. And finally, a decade after returning from Thailand, she began writing fiction again. The result was Rice without Rain, a story centering on Jinda, a seventeen-year-old girl from the fictitious Maekung Village which was caught up in the political winds sweeping across the country when a group of university students from Bangkok arrived to encourage the landless farmers to take up a rent resistance movement. Set against the very same historical background as Ho had experienced herself, Jinda's realization that the peasant class was but pawns in the ongoing political tug-of-war and her journey to find her own path in life told the untold stories during those years of turmoil that shrouded Thailand.\nFive years later Ho published her third book, The Clay Marble. This time she drew her inspiration from the interaction with Cambodian refugees during her relief work on the Thai-Cambodian border. Once again, she presented a strong female protagonist, a twelve-year-old girl named Dara who was one of the thousands of refugees escaping to the border at the end of the Khmer Rouge regime when Vietnam invaded the country. She also employed the theme of family unity in the face of adversity, as Dara persuaded her elder brother not to join the army but to return with family, sans their father, to restart life back at home.\nIn 1983, Ho returned to Singapore, where she worked as the writer-in-residence at the National University of Singapore for the next seven years. As a result, she is widely referred to there as a \"local writer\". Her works have been selected as teaching material for English literature in lower secondary schools. Since 1990, Ho has been living with her family in Ithaca, New York. She has also traveled and made presentations at various writing workshops in middle schools and high schools in the United States and international schools in Switzerland, Indonesia, Thailand, Poland, and Malaysia.\nAfter the birth of her third and last child Ho shifted her focus to writing books for children. Collaborating with Saphan Ros, executive director of the Cambodian Association of Greater Philadelphia, she published two books on traditional Cambodian folktales, The Two Brothers and Brother Rabbit: A Cambodian Tale. In the meantime, she even translated sixteen Tang poems into English and compiled them into a picture book titled Maples in the Mist: Children's Poems from the Tang Dynasty. In 2004, she returned to writing for more mature readers with Gathering the Dew, a story of how a young Cambodian girl who lost her sister during the Khmer Rouge regime learnt to reconcile with life's harsh realities and live on.\n",

Her second sister Daisy is the Chairman of SJM Holdings, her third sister Josie is a singer, and her brother Lawrence is also a businessman.\nShe attended an all-girls high school Castilleja School in Palo Alto, California and went on to attend Santa Clara University, graduating with a bachelor's degree in marketing and business. Ho had also attended St. Paul's Convent School in Causeway Bay (Hong Kong) as part of her Junior and Senior High School.\nJohnson & Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island awarded her an honorary doctorate in May 2007.\nIn 1981, Ho began a brief career in the Hong Kong entertainment industry, appearing with actor Danny Chan, who himself had then just been in the industry for two years, in the TVB series Breakthrough (\u7a81\u7834). Later, at age 26, she launched her own public relations firm. She also supported her sister Josie Ho's efforts to establish her own singing career in the early 1990s over the objection of their father.Ho owns 29% of the MGM Grand Macau, an association which has proven controversial for business partner MGM Mirage. Nevada's Gaming Control Board and Gaming Commission held extensive hearings in March 2007 on the matter of MGM's partnership with Ho, after which they found that she was a suitable business partner. However, in March 2010, she was barred from running a gaming business in New Jersey due to state gaming regulators' conclusion, based on Cap 148 Gambling Ordinance (kui yau yat tiu gui lun), that her father has \"extensive ties\" to organised crime, and MGM Mirage was ordered to \"disengage itself from any business association\" with her.After the passing of her father on 26 May 2020, she is expected to consolidate control under the Sociedade de Jogos de Macau umbrella.\nHo married Julian Hui, son of shipping magnate Hui Sai-fun, in 1991. They divorced in 2000. Late in their marriage, both began seeking other relationships; Ho entered into a relationship with Gilbert Yeung, the son of her father's hospitality and entertainment industry competitor, Albert Yeung. However, Gilbert Yeung's arrest for drug possession in August 2000 at Ho's birthday party focused unwanted media attention on Ho and her relationship with him; Ho's father also made comments in interviews threatening to disown her if she married him. This led to the end of Ho's relationship with Yeung, and also the public announcement that she and Hui would be seeking a divorce.Ho's ties to Chinese organised crime have also been reported by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, citing a U.S. Senate committee and several government agencies, when the state investigated her ties to American casino operator MGM Mirage. Ho's father, Stanley Ho, was also named by the Canadian Government, citing the Manila Standard newspaper, as having a link to the Kung Lok Triad (Chinese mafia) and as being linked to \"several illegal activities\" during the period 1999\u20132002.\nIn 2018, she spent HK$900 million on a property in one of Hong Kong's most exclusive neighbourhoods, The Peak, then Asia's second-highest price for a residential property.In Aug 2020, Ho lodged a caveat over her father\u2019s estate at the Probate Registry in Hong Kong after her sister and cousin to register an interest in the handling of her father's will.\n\n\n== References ==\n",

Together with other students, he was expelled in 1988 for protesting about the lack of investigation into the death of another student.\nFollowing involvement with protests, Htein Lin, together with other activists, withdrew to camps on the border with India. Here he became a member of the All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF), opposed to the Burmese military regime.  During this period, he studied with the artist Sitt Nyein Aye from Mandalay, learning about western artists such as Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. He used his skills to add illustrations the publications of the ABSDF. He was involved with internal conflicts within the ABSDF in 1991 and was imprisoned. In 1993, Htein Lin continued his law degree, which he completed in 1994.\nInstead of working in the legal profession, Htein Lin became an artist and also an actor in comic films (as \"Htein Htein\") in the mid 1990s. He led the way with modern Burmese performance art. His artistic performances included The Little Worm in the Ear, in Yangon, and Guitarist in 1996.\nHtein Lin spent 6\u00bd years as a political prisoner in Burma from 1998-2004. He continued to perform for fellow inmates in prison. Officially, he was not permitted to paint while imprisoned. However, he  managed to produce several hundred paintings secretly, using white cotton prison uniforms, as well as about a thousand drawings. He bribed the prison guards to smuggle paint to him, but it was too dangerous to have a paintbrush in his cell. Instead, he used various objects that were available to him, including cigarette lighters, pieces of glass, plates, nets, razor blades, syringes, or simply his fingers and hands. He used a monoprint technique.\nAfter his release from prison in 2004, he returned to art and performance. His May 2005 Rangoon street performance entitled Mobile Art Gallery/Mobile Market meant he was interrogated by the authorities again.\nHe was introduced in 2005 to the British Ambassador in Yangon, Vicky Bowman, who took receipt of his prison paintings and ensured their preservation by loaning them to  the Burma Archives Project at the International Institute of Social History  in Amsterdam. He later married Bowman and they moved to live in London for seven years.\nDuring his time in the UK, Htein Lin undertook performance art in Trafalgar Square, central London, on 1 June 2008.He also had exhibitions and performed in Finland, France, Norway, Thailand, Czech Republic and the United States of America. In addition, he has performed at the 2007 Venice Biennale and at festivals in Finland, Japan, Malaysia, and the Philippines. His performances draw on his artistic life as well as aiming to raise awareness of the Burmese political situation.\nHtein Lin has continued to use the monoprint technique in his subsequent paintings. These draw on his Theravada Buddhist faith, Burmese symbols and traditions, his early experience as a comedian in \"anyeint\" satirical performances, and events such as Cyclone Nargis and the Saffron Revolution.\nIn 2013, Htein Lin returned to live in Rangoon, and commenced his project A Show of Hands Project. In 2014 he returned one week in prison to train prisoners to Vipassana meditation and monoprint painting techniques  In November 2015, Htein Lin campaigned in the delta area for the National League for Democracy of Aung San Suu Kyi  and his native township Ingapu.\nIn the aftermath of the 2021 Myanmar coup d'\u00e9tat, he was reportedly detained in Yangon on 24 August 2022, along with his wife Vicky Bowman, and charged with immigration offences. PEN America called for his immediate release. He was released in November 2022, as part of a mass pardon to mark National Day.\nHe is married to the former British Ambassador to Myanmar, Vicky Bowman, and they have one daughter.\n",

In 1996, she received her Bachelors of Science in biochemistry and molecular biology.Hu then moved to the United States to work as a research technician for one year at the University of California, San Francisco. She then pursued her graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley. Under the mentorship of Corey S. Goodman, Hu explored the role of the plexin receptor and the Rho family GTPases in central nervous system development in Drosophila. Plexins are receptors involved in axon guidance, and Hu discovered a seven amino acid sequence in plexin, PlexB, which is necessary for Rac-GTP binding and subsequently axon guidance. Interestingly, PlexB inhibits Rac from binding downstream interactors while at the same time enhancing RhoA activity, altogether driving axon guidance. In further work, Hu found that CrossGAP, a GTPase-activating protein, is responsible for regulating Rac dependent-cytoskeletal changes during axon guidance in Drosophila. Hu completed her PhD in 2002.Following her PhD, Hu pursued her postdoctoral work under the mentorship of Julius Zhu and Roberto Malinow at the University of Virginia. In 2004, Hu moved to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and then to the University of California, San Diego in 2006, to continue working under the mentorship of Malinow. During her postdoc, Hu explored the role of AMPA receptor trafficking in emotional enhancement of memory formation as well as the role of Ras GTPase signalling in fragile X syndrome.\nIn 2008, Hu returned to China and joined the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai and became the principal investigator of the Hu Lab. Her lab has been focusing on the neural mechanisms of social dominance in mice as well as the neural mechanisms of depression and the antidepressant effects of ketamine.

He is a direct descendant of the Ming dynasty general Hu Zongxian, known for fighting Japanese pirates. His branch of the family migrated from Jixi County, Anhui to Taizhou during his grandfather's generation. Though his father owned a small tea trading business in Taizhou, the family was relatively poor. His mother was a teacher and died when he was 7, and he was raised by an aunt. Hu's father was denounced during the Cultural Revolution, an event that (together with his relatively humble origins) apparently had a deep effect upon Hu, who diligently tried to clear his father's name.He joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in April 1964. That year he graduated from Tsinghua University after studying hub hydropower stations at the Water Conservancy Engineering Department. He began working in July 1965 as an engineer.In 1968, during the Third Front construction,:\u200a179\u200a Hu volunteered for his service in Gansu and worked on the construction of Liujiaxia Hydroelectric Station while also managing CCP affairs for the local branch of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power. From 1969 to 1974, he worked for Sinohydro Engineering Bureau.Hu is married to Liu Yongqing, whom he met at Tsinghua University when they were studying there. They have two children together, Hu Haifeng and Hu Haiqing. Unlike Wen Jiabao, the premier, he never granted a public one-on-one interview with the media.\nHe has been noted for his liking of table tennis and ballroom dancing.\nHu is also said to possess a photographic memory that became evident in his high school days.\nIn 1973, Hu was transferred to the Construction Department of Gansu as a secretary. The next year he was promoted to deputy senior party secretary. In 1980, Deng Xiaoping implemented the \"Four Transformations\" program, which aimed to produce communist leaders who were \"more revolutionary, younger, more knowledgeable, and more specialized.\" In response to this nationwide search for young party members, Song Ping, the first secretary of CCP Gansu Committee (Gansu's governor) discovered Hu Jintao and promoted him several ranks to the position of deputy head of the commission. Another prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Song, Wen Jiabao, also became prominent at the same time.\nIn 1982, Hu was promoted to the position of Communist Youth League Gansu Branch secretary and was appointed as the director of the All-China Youth Federation. His mentor, Song Ping, was transferred to Beijing as Minister of Organization of the Chinese Communist Party, and was in charge of senior cadres' recommendation, candidacy and promotion. With the support of Hu Yaobang (no relation) and Deng Xiaoping, Hu was assured of a bright future in the party. At Song Ping's suggestion, in 1982 central CCP authorities invited Hu to Beijing to study at the Central Party School. Soon after, he was transferred to Beijing and appointed to a position in the secretariat of the Communist Youth League Central Committee (\"CY Central\"). Two years later Hu was promoted to first secretary of CY Central, thus its actual leader. During his term in the Youth League, Hu escorted Hu Yaobang, who was CCP general secretary then, in visits around the country. Hu Yaobang, himself a veteran coming from the Youth League, could reminiscence his youth through Hu's company.\n",

As a child, he would often spend time in a grove of Tsuki-j\u014d in Saitama, consisting of trees that were several hundreds of years old. He started drawing, because he wanted to depict the beauty of these trees. He graduated from Tama Art University, where he studied oil painting from 1989 on. He was classmates with fellow manga artist Hiroaki Samura, but the two of them only properly met later while working for the same manga magazine. After graduating, he travelled through Japan and sketched landscapes that he saw.In 1993, Igarashi won the newcomer award Afternoon Shiki Sh\u014d (\"Afternoon Seasons Prize\") of the manga magazine Afternoon with the short story \"Ohayashi ga kikoeru hi\" (\"A Day Festival Music Is Heard\") and its publication in the February 1994 issue of Afternoon was his debut as a professional manga artist. The short story is set in Tsuki-j\u014d shrine. He had previously submitted the manga to the sh\u014djo manga magazine LaLa, but the magazine's editors rejected it due to its lack of romance in the story and advised Igarashi to submit it to a seinen manga magazine. \"Ohayashi ga kikoeru hi\" became the first chapter of the series Hanashippanashi, consisting of different short stories. He focused on a series consisting of short stories in order to still experiment with styles and themes in the beginning of his career. Hanashippanashi was serialized in Afternoon until 1996. In the following six years he only published some short stories, which were collected in the book Sora Tobi Tamashii in 2002.\nHis career took off in 2002.

The series was adapted into two live-action films in Japan 2014 and 2015 and into another live-action film in South Korea in 2018.In 2003 he started working for other publishers than Kodansha. In Shogakukan's then new manga magazine Ikki, he published the series Witches until 2004. From 2006 until 2011 he drew Children of the Sea for the same magazine. Both works received awards and Children of the Sea was adapted into an anime film in 2019 by Studio 4\u00b0C. Under Shogakukan's Ikki Comics imprint, he published the two-volume series Saru in 2010 as a collaboration with novelist K\u014dtar\u014d Isaka, who published the novel SOS no Saru at the same time, with the novel and the manga referencing each other.He also drew smaller work for publishers other than Kodansha and Shogakukan. In 2005, French comic artist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Boilet invited him to create a short story about Iwate Prefecture and the cover illustration for the French-Japanese anthology Japan: As Viewed by 17 Creators. Igarashi has also published short stories in the alternative manga magazine Manga Erotics F, the lifestyle magazine Brutus and Shueisha's manga magazine Jump X.\nHe returned to working for Kodansha in 2015, publishing the series Designs in Afternoon until 2019.

            "early_life": "Ijewere  initially studied science and maths at A-level, using photography as a creative break from what she thought of as those more 'serious' subjects. Falling in love with photography, she decided to enroll to study it at the London College of Fashion, and it was during her time there that she started to become more concerned about some of the unsettling undertones in fashion imagery, particularly the stereotypes used in the portrayal of non-Western cultures. During her final year she started casting mixed-race models who fell outside the industry norm - something that has become central to her work.\nAfter graduating, Ijewere shunned the conventional career path of starting as a photographer's assistant, as she felt it important to   have the freedom to shoot in ways that would protect her own vision. Instead, she worked for an interior design company, maintaining her photographic passion by spending almost every spare moment and weekend photographing her mixed-raced friends.  By posting her early work on social media, she gradually built up her reputation, leading to professional commissions.Ijewere has worked with a large number of companies with fashion interests, including Dazed, i-D, Stella McCartney, Nike and Gap. In 2017 her work featured at Unseen and Lagos Photo Festival. More recently she has worked for Dior, Hermes, Nina Ricci and Valentino.At age 26, Ijewere became the first woman of colour to shoot a cover for Vogue, anywhere in the world. Her January 2019 cover for the UK edition featured images of Dua Lipa, Binx Walton, and Letitia Wright on the Kentish coast. Asked for her thoughts on the Vogue commission, she said, \"I feel like in doing this I'm proving to younger girls from a similar background that it's achievable. It also feels like part of a broader shift within our culture to include far more diversity, both behind the camera and in front of it. As a girl, I never identified with anyone in the pages of magazines. Now, we're sending a message that everyone is welcome in fashion.\"Ijewere does most of her model casting personally, often choosing models who do not conform to conventional industry standards.  She notes, \"I especially like to photograph those from ethnicities that are under-represented. London is such a diverse place and I feel that needs to be reflected within the fashion world.\" She has stated that her work is \"all about the celebration of diversity without creating a representation \u2013 particularly for women, as we are the ones who are more exposed to beauty ideals and to not being comfortable in who we are\".Ijewere's first book is a monograph titled Our Own Selves (2021).\n\n\n== References ==\n",

            "early_life": "Born in Kobe, Japan on 10 September 1930, Fumiko is the eldest daughter of the Buddhist  historian, Ikawa Joukei. She studied English at an early age at the suggestion of her mother, a secondary school teacher. She graduated with an undergraduate degree from Tsuada College which subsequently became Tsuda University in 1953 with her thesis on the critical essays by T. S. Eliot.She used her proficiency in English to secure a clerical position with Masao Oka, an ethnologist at the department of sociology at Tokyo Metropolitan University and assisted with his lectures and research. This experience led her to resign her position in 1954 in order to study anthropology as a postgraduate student at the same institution. Fumiko focused on the ancient civilisations of Central America which meant that she met Clyde Kluckhohn who in turn introduced her to American anthropology. He was in Japan in order to give a series of seminars on American Studies. This meeting caused her to take a leave of absence and obtain a Fulbright Program to study for a year at Harvard University.Fumiko had intended to specialise in Central American archaeology under Gordon Willey. But once she studied with Hallam Movius she decided to specialise in Early Palaeolithic cultures in [Asia]. She obtained an A. M. in anthropology, from Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, in 1958. In 1959 she married Philip E. L. Smith, an archaeologist interested in prehistory whom she had met at Harvard University. In 1960 they moved to Canada, with their son, as Philip had obtained a teaching job at the University of Toronto, Ontario. She obtained her PhD from Harvard University in 1974 with her doctoral thesis on the Early Palaeolithic cultures of Japan.\nShe accompanied her husband to excavate in Egypt, on the Canadian Expedition to Egyptian Nubia from September 1962 to May 1963. The small group was headed by Philip E.L. Smith, with the title of the \u201cCanadian Expedition to Egyptian Nubia\u201d, was Canadian government's contribution to the International salvage archaeology efforts in connection with the Aswan Dam construction. After spending the summer in Japan, they returned to Toronto for the academic year. Upon their return to Canada when Philip, her husband resumed teaching, she was employed with the Expedition funds as research assistant to sort and label artifacts. She subsequently became a lecturer in the department of anthropology at the University of Toronto. She started teaching part-time at McGill University in  Montreal in 1966 as her husband, Philip, started to teach at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. After a few years of part-time teaching, she was appointed assistant professor of anthropology in 1970, associate professor in 1974 and granted tenure. She obtained her PhD from Harvard University in 1974 for her dissertation on the Early Palaeolithic cultures of Japan. She was promoted to associate professor in 1975. A year after she obtained her PhD in 1975, she became the chair of the anthropology department at  McGill University.   She became professor in 1979.Fumiko has two strands in her career: a university administrator and a researcher. She was the chair of the anthropology department in 1975, soon after being granted tenure and promoted to Associate Professor. She suspected that she was promoted to chair as each of the well-established full professors in the department: Peter Gutkind, Richard Anthony Salisbury, and Bruce G. Trigger might try to influence her. She is reported to have said that she thought at the time that each established academic thought he could persuade her to carry out his own agenda, as \"I was a woman, a Japanese woman at that, who is supposed to be docile. I think I became a chair not \"in spite of\" being a woman, but \"because\" of being a woman.\u201dShe was director of the Centre for East Asian Studies at McGill University between 1983 and 1988. She was the associate vice-principal (academic) of McGill University in 1991 until 1996. This was, at the time, the highest-ranking position a woman had ever been appointed to at McGill University. She later discovered that she obtained the job \"because of\" her  gender as the vice-principal (academic), who was a male  biologist, was looking for a female  humanities person to be his associate vice-principal. She was appointed as associate vice-principal (academic) in 1991. This position meant that she assisted in the development of both research units by obtaining external grants to add teaching positions in the Centre for East Asian Studies and to invite numerous visiting professors from Japan. As associate vice-principal (academic) part of her duties entailed the creation of academic exchanges and collaboration agreements with universities outside of  Canada, strengthening McGill's  presence in Asia. She was charged to undertake this task in Asia by then principal of the university, David Johnston, latterly Governor General of Canada. She helped to establish more than dozen agreements between  McGill University and universities in Japan and to create the existing programme for Japanese students to spend the summer at McGill University studying English and Canadian culture.She is research active despite having retired from McGill University in 2003. She held two visiting professorships: one at Kwansei Gakuin University, Japan in 1996-1997 and another at El Colegio de M\u00e9xico, Mexico City, Mexico in October 2002\n",

Claiming to have in fact been sixteen years of age when she starred in this softcore sex film, Ike caused a scandal. The publicity only served to make the film one of Toei's most profitable films of the 1970s.In her third film, director Norifumi Suzuki's Modern Porno Tale: Inherited Sex Mania (1971), Ike co-starred with French erotic actress, Sandra Julien. Eirin, the Japanese film-rating board, objected to the graphic lesbian scenes between the two actresses, and this film had to be severely cut before it could be released theatrically. Ike decided to stop performing in nude scenes after this film, concentrating instead on films in the delinquent girl subgenre of S&M films. Ike starred in five of Toei's seven Sukeban (delinquent schoolgirl) films made between 1971 and 1974.

            "early_life": "Ikeda Tatsuo was born in Imari, Saga prefecture in 1928 as the eldest son of a stonemason.:\u200a196\u200a As a young witness to the escalation of imperial aggression and militarist ideology through the 1930s and early 40s, Ikeda's early education was heavily shaped by the nationalist sentiments that colored the atmosphere of the era. After enrolling in Imari Commercial High School in 1941, he was put in a military training course, where he recalled hearing the broadcast of the Imperial Japanese Navy's entrance into war in the Pacific following the bombing of Pearl Harbor.In 1943, at the age of 15, Ikeda and his classmates were called upon to volunteer to serve in the armed forces. Told to commit on the spot without consulting their families, Ikeda was the first of his class to stand up and volunteer, prompted by a conviction that he would eventually have to serve regardless. He was subsequently drafted into the Imperial Japanese Navy to train as a kamikaze pilot in Kagoshima.:\u200a196\u200a Before he was dispatched on a suicide mission, the war came to an end, allowing him to escape the fate that befell his fellow pilots.The end of the war left Ikeda with a sense of traumatic disillusionment, and he described his sentiments during this period as follows: \"Young people had grown up being fed the lesson that sacrifice for the country and becoming a god enshrined at Yasukuni [i.e., dying in the war] was the road to eternal righteousness. We were all hurtling down that road with no time to think. When the road suddenly cut off, it led to great sorrow and confusion.\u201d:\u200a79\u200aAfter the dismissal of the pilots, Ikeda took a four-day journey from Kasumigaura to Imari. Upon passing through Hiroshima, he recalled seeing an \"utterly empty landscape, which felt absolutely horrible. At the time, there was not yet a word for 'atomic bomb', so we had just seen flyers that read 'Enemy drops new type of bomb.'\" Ikeda reached Saga in late August 1945, and enrolled in a teaching school later that year after learning that his middle school credentials would be accepted.:\u200a196\u200a \"I didn't want to be a teacher,\" Ikeda recalled. \"I just wanted to learn, and also not have to pay tuition.\"However, after the GHQ prohibited former military personnel from taking teaching positions due to suspicions regarding the potential of lingering militarist sentiments to seep into postwar education practices, Ikeda was expelled from the teaching school in 1946.:\u200a196\u200a After working on a base in Sasebo, Nagasaki, a land reclamation project in Imari Bay, and briefly apprenticing at a Nabeshima ware pottery studio, Ikeda resolved to pursue the visual arts, and made his first oil painting, a self-portrait made in the style of Tsune Nakamura\u2019s Portrait of Vasilii Yaroschenko (1920).:\u200a22\u200a Ikeda gained admission to the Tama Art and Design School (now Tama Art University) with the painting as part of his portfolio, and moved to Tokyo in 1948 to begin his studies.\nThough he had originally enrolled with the intention of studying oil painting, Ikeda quickly lost interest in academism and instead began to immerse himself in Tokyo's avant-garde circles.:\u200a138\u200a Ikeda's classmates at Tama included Hiroshi Katsuragawa and Masahiro Mori. At the invitation of a friend, he joined Tar\u014d Okamoto and Kiyoteru Hanada's Avant-garde Art Study Group, which brought together artists and writers to discuss and debate the paths to developing artistic paradigms that broke free from the clutches of the old militarist order.:\u200a138\u200a Ikeda quickly grew disillusioned with the conservatism of the university and his instructors. After seeing a portrait of the imperial crown prince on a ski holiday by Ihara Usaburo, one of his professors, that confirmed his ambivalence about the academy, Ikeda dropped out in late 1948.:\u200a80\u200aThe study group was but one of the many collectives (many of which shared members and goals) formed during the early postwar years that sought to redefine creative production amidst a rapidly changing and unstable political milieu, reimagine the social role of creatives, encourage artistic experimentation, and provide publishing and exhibition platforms. As few formal exhibition spaces and sponsoring bodies supporting avant-garde art existed at the time, many artists in early postwar Japan took it upon themselves to organize their own shows. Members of the group included writers Kiichi Sasaki, K\u014db\u014d Abe, photographer Sh\u014dz\u014d Kitadai, and artists Katsuhiro Yamaguchi and Hideko Fukushima.:\u200a138\u200aThough these groups were short-lived, they provided a crucial intellectual foundation, marked by Marxist and Surrealist influences, that influenced a generation of post-war artists and movements. Younger artists broke off from the groups to form collections such as Jikken K\u014db\u014d.:\u200a91\u200a Ikeda, who also affiliated with groups such as Seiki no Kai, NON, and Seibiren, participated in a number of organizations independently organized by the groups. Seibiren\nHis works from the early 1950s, which feature fragmentary geometries and constellated symbols demarcated by strong, dark outlines reveal the influences of Cubism and Surrealism on the young artist\u2019s nascent practice. At the encouragement of Okamoto Taro, Ikeda submitted his work to the second annual  Yomiuri Ind\u00e9pendant Exhibition in 1950.\n",

He first entered the entertainment business in the late 1970s as an actor with Shuji Terayama's theatrical group Tenj\u014d Sajiki.His film debut was in the 1981 Genji Nakamura pink film Semi Documentary: Housewife Prostitution Team aka Document Porno: Married Woman Prostitution Techniques. In contrast to his stage career, in his screen work, Ikejima has stayed in the erotic genres. Between 1981 and 1988 he appeared in over 500 softcore pink films, working for such directors as Hisayasu Sat\u014d, Y\u014djir\u014d Takita and Ry\u016bichi Hiroki. Ikejima appeared in Sat\u014d's gay-themed Temptation of the Mask (1987), a film significant for joining three of the \"Four Devils\" or \"Four Heavenly Kings of Pink\" (\u30d4\u30f3\u30af\u56db\u5929\u738b, pinku shitenno) in one work. Ikejima became one of Zeze Takahisa's \"Zeze-gumi\" (Zeze-group) of regulars including Takeshi It\u014d, Y\u014dta Kawase and Yumeka Sasaki. Though most awarded and recognized as a director, Ikejima has continued acting to the present day.He began his directorial career in 1988, at first working mainly in AVs (adult videos). His cinematic theatrical debut as a director was The Masturbating Lesbian (\u30b6\u30fb\uff2f\uff2e\uff21\uff2e\uff29\uff25\u30ec\u30ba, Za Onanie Rezu) (1991). Through his production company Cement Match, Ikejima both stages plays and self-produces film. Cement Match has made films for all of the major pink film distribution companies, but most often produces for OP Eiga. Through this company he has produced such prominent pink films as Daisuke Goto's A Lonely Cow Weeps at Dawn (2003) and ENK's The Gays in Wonderland (1997). Also active in gay-themed films in both acting and directing careers, the 1996 gay film, Love Me Danger, directed by Ikejima, was chosen the 6th Best Film at the Pink Grand Prix. His Men Who Love (2002) was one of the first pink films to be shown at the Tokyo International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival.In his pink film directorial career, Ikejima usually collaborates with his wife, screenwriter Ky\u014dko Godai, who had previously made a name for herself scripting for Hisayasu Sat\u014d. Known for his professionalism and efficiency, when the original pink film version of The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai went over-budget and behind schedule (because of its ambition and precarious production history, Jasper Sharp characterizes it as the Apocalypse Now of the pink film world), Ikejima was called in to film a temporary replacement, a task he accomplished in a few days. In 2008 Ikejima directed his 100th pink film, an accomplishment for which he was given a special award at the Pink Grand Prix.\n",

            "early_life": "As a child Ikemoto was a fan of Bikkuriman stickers. However, since he could not afford them, he instead drew his own stickers. Ikemoto's friends enjoyed them so much that they started buying stickers from him. By this point of his life, Ikemoto felt he had the talent for art.In March 1997, Mikio Ikemoto submitted his first one-shot manga, titled Cosmos, to the manga magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump, for which he won a Tenkaichi Manga Award. The one-shot was later published in the July 7 issue of the magazine, gaining a small cult following despite its mature subject matter. Cosmos was then serialized in Monthly Plasma, an independent manga magazine, from June 1997 to September 1999, and a sequel one-shot was published in the April 26, 1999 issue of Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump.\nBy this time Ikemoto had become interested in the work of fellow rookie manga artist Masashi Kishimoto. Upon hearing that Ikemoto had been contacted by Shueisha to work as an assistant on a comedy series and was moving to Tokyo, Kishimoto felt that his art would be wasted on that genre. With work beginning on the Naruto serialization, Kishimoto asked his editor, Kosuke Yahagi, to scout Ikemoto and recruit him as an assistant. Ikemoto was grateful for the offer, since he felt that Naruto's genre was what he had originally wanted to work on, and accepted the job, beginning work with the seventh chapter. During the early days of making Naruto, Ikemoto was Kishimoto's youngest assistant, and the latter jokingly said this made him and his other assistants envious. Ikemoto's responsibilities included drawing crowds and background figures, adding white to speed lines, highlights and characters' eyes, whiting out art that went out of the panels, putting stars in night skies, and adding in half-tones. He was also occasionally tasked with creating the designs for new characters. Ikemoto recalls how often Kishimoto requested his help with adding more details to the manga chapters, leading him to draw more clones created by Naruto Uzumaki as well as an unspecified character who could become giant.When the manga ended in 2014, Shueisha asked Kishimoto to start a sequel. However, Kishimoto rejected the idea and proposed that Ikemoto draw it based on the experience he had. Kishimoto advised Ikemoto not to imitate his art style and instead make his own. While noting long-time fans might be disappointed with the fact that Kishimoto is not drawing Boruto, Ikemoto stated he would do his best in the making of the manga. Ikemoto mentioned he remained optimistic about his art style. Kishimoto also revises the manga's scenario. Besides illustrating the manga, Ikemoto also provides illustrations for the Boruto light novels. The manga had one million copies in print as of January 2017 while Studio Pierrot also produced an anime series based on it.\n",

            "early_life": "Olivia Jean Markel was born on February 23, 1990, to Brent O. Markel and Julie V. (Philippo) Markel. She has an older sister, Sarah, a younger brother, Brent, and a younger sister, Katlyn who died in 2019. Her paternal grandmother, Patricia (Berdon) Markel is of Filipino descent.Jean was raised in St. Clair Shores, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. Her parents encouraged their four children to be creative. For her seventh birthday, Jean got her first guitar and started teaching herself to play. Shortly after that, as an Elmwood Elementary second grader, she formed her first band called Broken Glass. In middle school, along with a friend on bass and her younger brother on drums, Jean formed the Yazuka Drag Queens. Playing original songs, they won their school's talent show and went on to open at a show for a local band, Genders. On April 16, 2003, Jean's mom took her to Detroit's Masonic Temple to see her first concert, The White Stripes.By high school, Jean was a self-taught multi-instrumentalist and songwriter who spent her free time recording her own music using a computer microphone and layering the individual instrument recordings on top of each other using a free music editing program. At 16, she began playing small clubs around Detroit and handing out her homemade demo CDs to friends, family, and co-workers. \u201cIt was a hobby,\u201d she stated to the New York Times in 2022. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could make money off of music.\u201dAfter high school, Jean enrolled in graphic design school.\nAfter The Black Belles disbanded in 2012, Jean took about a year off before going back into the studio. Using previously recorded music that didn't quite fit for The Black Belles, she had enough material for a solo album. Bathtub Love Killings was released on September 14, 2014. The title was inspired by a serial killer from the 1800's who killed three women in a bathtub. Jean wrote all of the songs and played almost every instrument herself.\nOn April 8, 2022, Jack White proposed to Jean near the end of a Supply Chain Issues Tour concert performance at Detroit's Masonic Temple, while \"Hotel Yorba\" was being played. Jean and White were married shortly afterward by White's business partner Ben Swank, who officiated on stage and was joined by family members.\n",

Patton began making her own music in 2008, and was inspired by her mother to pursue a unique sound. She also received encouragement from figures such as DJ Rashad, who she communicated with online.After making the track \"Erotic Heat\", she was hesitant to release it because it did not fit the conventional sound of a footwork song. The track was ultimately released on Planet Mu's Bangs & Works, Vol. 2 compilation in 2011, which showcased Chicago juke and footwork artists and brought Jlin attention. The song was later used to accompany a 2014 Rick Owens fashion show. She released her debut album Dark Energy in 2015 to critical acclaim. Dark Energy would help to popularize footwork on a global stage.In 2017, Jlin released her second album Black Origami.

When the Korean War broke out, Jo Jeong-rae and his family evacuated to the South, where he was unpopular with the local children and frequently fought with them, fights he generally lost. He was interested in literature from early in life, and won competitions in elementary school. He majored in Korean literature at Dongguk University, and worked as a high school teacher for several years after graduation. His literary debut was in 1970 when he published the short story \"A False Charge\" (\ub204\uba85), after which he decided to devote his entire life to literature.\nJo Jeong-rae's popular multi-volume novels Taebaek Mountain Range (\ud0dc\ubc31\uc0b0\ub9e5, 1983-1989) and Arirang (\uc544\ub9ac\ub791, 1995), both of which have come to be considered modern classics since their publication in the 1980s, are widely considered to be the epitome of his talent. With the publication of his novel Han River (\ud55c\uac15, 2002), Jo Jeong-rae finally completed his trilogy of works dedicated to modern Korean history. Sales of the series reached record-breaking numbers in South Korea, selling over 10 million copies.The epic historical trilogy, begun in 1983 and eventually completed in 2002, comprises Jo Jeong-rae's three most well-known novels: Taebaek Mountain Range, Arirang, and Han River. Each novel is over ten volumes in length, and each deals with different aspects of the turbulent history of Korea in the modern era. The first novel, Taebaek Mountain Range, examines the five-year period between the liberation of Korea from Japanese colonial rule in 1945 to the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, with detailed flashbacks and backstory contextualizing the deep ideological conflict that culminated in violence and the division of Korea. The second novel, Arirang, is technically a prequel to Taebaek Mountain Range, and covers the Japanese colonial period of Korean history.One of the primary themes in Jo Jeong-rae's work, concern regarding the socio-economic roots of the division of Korea and the search for Korean reunification, is also present in his other, shorter works of fiction, particularly his later works, such as \"Sorrow, That Shaded Place\" (\ud55c \uadf8 \uadf8\ub298\uc758 \uc790\ub9ac), \"Land of Exile\" (\uc720\ud615\uc758 \ub545), \"Human Stairs\" (\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uacc4\ub2e8), and \"The Soul of a Barren Land\" (\ubc15\ud1a0\uc758 \ud63c). Many of his earlier works, however, such as \"A Woman from Cheongsan\" (\uccad\uc0b0\ub301), \"The Violent Instructor\" (\ud401\ub140\uc11d \uad50\uc0ac), \"The Shaded Slope\" (\ube44\ud0c8\uc9c4 \uc74c\uc9c0), \"The Age of Geocentrism\" (\ucc9c\ub3d9\uc124 \uc2dc\ub300), and \"Foreign Land\" (\uc774\ubc29\uc9c0\ub300), tend to reconstruct stories of traditional rustic life, targeting and satirizing the various absurdities of life in a much more general fashion.\n",

            "early_life": "Jo Mingyu was born in Taebaek, his mother was a kindergarten teacher, while his father taught at the Taebeak Mechanical Technical High School. He started learning music from a very young age, upon the wishes of his mother, who dreamt of being a singer. She supported both of her children to learn music, Jo's older sister studied piano. In 1998, the family moved to Chuncheon. After his sister stopped playing the piano in 2004, Jo's mother turned her full attention to the musical education of her son, which he considers to be a turning point in his life.In 2006, he was admitted to Seoul Arts High School, then in 2009, he started his education at Seoul National University, studying vocal music. He participated in several singing competitions, where he became a semi-finalist, finalist or winner. In 2011, he became the youngest finalist of the DongA Music Competition. This year he lent his singing voice to actor Lee David in the war film The Front Line.During this period, he became unsure of his future, as he failed to win several competitions and received harsh criticism. In 2013, he decided to further his studies at Seoul National University's graduate school. Here, he found new inspiration under the supervision of opera singer and university professor Kwangchul Youn. He also gave singing lessons at the university dorm. He started working for the Seoul Metropolitan Opera and participated in various stages.In 2015, he was a semi-finalist at the Montreal International Musical Competition, after which he started his compulsory military service as a conscripted policeman.  In 2016, at the Geneva International Music Competition, he was told he would not be able to get lead singing roles in opera, due to his light leggero tone. This shook his view of his future and considered quitting singing when he came across the first season of Phantom Singer and decided to apply for the second season. He thought crossover music might be a viable solution for his voice type.During the competition, Jo selected Ko Woo-rim for the 2nd round of the competition and trained him. Then, he selected Bae Doo-hoon for the 3rd round of the competition to add variety to the team color. In the final competition, Kang Hyung-ho joined the team. Jo Mingyu got the nickname \"Strategist\" during the competition because he meticulously considered each contestant's timbre and whether they would match his voice before selecting them.His first solo single, titled \"Sinsegye: New Age\" (\uc2e0\uc138\uacc4: New Age) was released in February 2020. In December 2021, he released his first minialbum, Sinsegye: Parana (\uc2e0\uc138\uacc4: Parana), followed by a two-day solo concert in Seoul.\n",

Her mother was a kindergarten teacher, and her father was a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official. She displayed interest in music and performance from an early age, practicing ballet and hip-hop dance. Jovanovi\u0107 cites late 90's and early 00's performers like Britney Spears, TLC, Jennifer Lopez and Destiny's Child as her biggest influences in music.In 2009, the family eventually permanently relocated to Belgrade, where Sara graduated from the Third Grammar School. She subsequently studied Italian language at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology.\nJovanovi\u0107 began her music career in 2011 by winning a contest organized by Serbian magazine Story with covers she had been posting on YouTube. As a reward she received a chance to record her first song, titled \"Zauvek\" (Forever), which she performed on the late-night talk show Ve\u010de sa Ivanom Ivanovi\u0107em. The following year, Jovanovi\u0107 was also featured on four songs released by rapper MCN for his self-titled debut album.\nIn 2012, she auditioned for the second season of Serbian televised singing competition Prvi glas Srbije, singing \"Halo\" in front of judges Vlado Georgiev, Aleksandra Radovi\u0107 and Sa\u0161a Milo\u0161evi\u0107 Mare. After progressing through the \"bootcamp\" phase, mentored by Radovi\u0107, Jovanovi\u0107 went on to the live shows, where she was noted for her showmanship, and thus was cited as the \"new energy on the music scene\" by Serbian Cosmopolitan. After nine weeks of competing, Jovanovi\u0107 reached the final where she finished as the second runner-up, behind Nevena Bo\u017eovi\u0107 and Mirna Radulovi\u0107.\nIn February of the following year, it was announced that the three finalists from Prvi glas Srbije would form a girl group called Moje 3 in order to compete at the 2013 Beosong music festival. At the beginning of March, they performed \"Ljubav je svuda\" (Love Is All Around), winning with 42.5% of the public votes and becoming Serbian representatives for the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. During the first semi-finals of Eurovision, which took place on May 14, Moje 3 performed as the last act of the evening, eventually placing 11th with 46 points, and thus failing to progress to the final. Furthermore, they received the Barbara Dex Award for the worst dressed act.Following the Eurovision, Jovanovi\u0107 pursued a solo career with \"Ujutru\" (In the Morning), released under IDJTunes, in collaboration with Marko Mandi\u0107, which was featured on his 2015 debut EP. Between September and December, she appeared on the first Serbian series of Your Face Sounds Familiar, winning in the 10th episode with the performance of \"Unconditionally\" as Katy Perry. In the final on December 28, she took second place, behind the season winner, Ana Koki\u0107. At the beginning of 2014, Jovanovi\u0107 covered \"Provokacija\" (Provocation) by Montenegrin singer Boban Rajovi\u0107 for the movie Little Buddho. In June, Sara released her debut solo single, titled \"Ko je ovde ko\" (Who's Who Here), again under IDJTunes. In March 2015, she released the ballad \"Mahovina\" (Moss) and, later in July 2016, reggae-infused \"Probaj\" (Try It). Jovanovi\u0107 reunited with Marko Mandi\u0107 in October 2016 to cover Moby Dick's \"Troje\" (The Three) for the film The Samurai in Autumn. She portrayed Cinderella as a main role in a musical, which premiered at Belgrade's Sava Centar on December 25, and later toured in theaters around Serbia.\nJovanovi\u0107 was in a year-long relationship with volleyball player Aleksandar Atanasijevi\u0107, which was ended in May 2014. In February 2015, she was reported to be dating Serbian actor Viktor Savi\u0107. The couple broke up the following year. Between 2016 and 2018, she was then romantically involved with rapper and writer Mar\u010delo.Jovanovi\u0107 is close friends with fashion influencer Dunja Jovani\u0107 and is often featured in her vlogs.

I wanted to do something that I was passionate about. In fact, I just finished high school because I did not want to make my mum sad.\"Joab then attended various acting schools and workshops, before he moved to New York to study at the Actors Studio. Joab, who spent his childhood imitating the voices of characters he watched on television, did not need to undergo accent training.

Following the announcement, several racist posts left on the Neighbours website had to be removed. Speaking to Paul Tatnell from the Herald Sun, Joab blamed the racism on a \"lack of education\". He elaborated \"There is various pockets that will say it is un-Australian to have an Indian or an Indian family on Ramsay St. Those Aussies who are saying it is un-Australian will be the same ones who pretty much supported the White Australia policy back in the day, you are never going to get away from that kind of stuff.\" Joab left Neighbours at the end of his contract in May 2013 to pursue acting work in Los Angeles.Joab starred in the twelve-part series Conspiracy 365 as Bruno in 2012.

He completed his MA and PhD at the University of Rochester, working under the supervision of American labour historian Herbert Gutman and Christopher Lasch on a dissertation that examined the Toronto working class during the transition to industrial capitalism. He would later publish this work in the Canadian Historical Association's Macdonald prize-winning book Toronto Workers Respond to Industrial Capitalism (1980). He followed this work with the co-authored (with Bryan Palmer), the CHA and AHA Corey prize-winning Dreaming of What Might Be: The Knights of Labor in Ontario (1982).\nIn 1976 Kealey helped found the journal Labour/Le Travail to provide an outlet for a new generation of scholars practising the \"new labour and working-class history,\" influenced by the work of E. P. Thompson and the Marxist tradition. He edited the journal from 1976 to 1997, when Bryan Palmer took over as editor.

Her uncle is former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean Sr., and her cousin is New Jersey State Senator Tom Kean Jr. \nShe grew up in New York City and attended Spence School and Bard College, and helped \"to found a Zen center in upstate New York\".\nKean worked as a photographer at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. After visiting Burma to interview political prisoners, in the 1990s she began working at a Berkeley radio station (KPFA, the flagship station of the Pacifica Radio Network) as an investigative journalist, producer and on-air host for 'Flashpoints,' a left-wing drive-time news program, covering wrongful convictions, the death penalty, and other criminal-justice issues.Kean has published works relating to UFOs since 2000, and has been a guest on Coast to Coast AM. Her book UFOs: Generals, Pilots and Government Officials Go on the Record, published by Penguin Random House, was a New York Times best seller. Kean belongs to the UFO organization UFODATA.On 16 December 2017, the New York Times featured an article written by Helene Cooper, Ralph Blumenthal and Kean, which revealed the fact that the US Department of Defense had spent $22.5M on a secret program titled the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program that investigated UFOs.On 5 June 2023, Kean and writer Ralph Blumenthal reported that former United States Air Force officer and intelligence official David Grusch claimed that the United States has a secret UFO retrieval program with multiple vehicles of non-human origin as well as records of dead pilots in its possession.\n",

            "early_life": "Kean grew up in the Berowra area and was educated at Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview before attaining a Bachelor of Business from the University of Technology, Sydney. He later completed a graduate diploma at the Institute of Chartered Accountants. While at university, he was elected to the UTS Student Representative Council and as the SRC Executive Member for the Haymarket Campus. Kean has been a member of the Liberal Party since 2001, and in 2008, he was elected vice-president of the NSW Young Liberals. During the 2003 State election campaign, Kean worked as an adviser for the Leader of the Opposition, John Brogden. He subsequently worked for Catherine Cusack MLC as an adviser while she was shadow minister for Juvenile Justice and Women.\nPrior to entering Parliament, Kean was briefly an accountant at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Aside from his brief time as an accountant, Kean's only professional experience has been as a political staffer.\nFollowing announcement of the retirement of the sitting member, Judy Hopwood, Kean contested pre-selection for the safe Liberal seat against Hornsby Mayor, Nick Berman, and Hornsby Councillor, Steve Russell. Kean won endorsement and Berman announced his decision to resign from the Liberal Party and run against Kean as an independent candidate at the 2011 State election. At the election, Kean was elected; however, the party suffered a swing of 3.5 points. Kean won the seat with 62.1 per cent of the two-party vote, with Berman being his main rival.\nKean used his inaugural speech to call on the government to spend as much money on suicide prevention campaigns as it does on road safety campaigns. His call for the $10 million campaign received support from Professor Ian Hickey and the Minister for Mental Health Kevin Humphries. He has hosted an annual Youth Forum in conjunction with Black Dog institute that aimed at educating students and teachers about issues relating to mental health; and has successfully campaigned for the construction of a new mental health inpatient facility in Hornsby.Following the resignation of Mike Baird as Premier, Gladys Berejiklian was elected as Liberal leader and sworn in as Premier. The Berejiklian ministry was subsequently formed, with Kean sworn in as the Minister for Innovation and Better Regulation, with effect from 30 January 2017. Following the 2019 state election, Kean was appointed as the Minister for Energy and Environment in the second Berejiklian ministry, with effect from 2 April 2019. Kean became embroiled in controversy soon after his appointment. In one of his first acts as Energy Minister, Kean appointed former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull inaugural chair of the government's net zero emissions advisory board. One week later Kean sacked Turnbull from the role, with Turnbull claiming Kean was pressured by right-wing media to do so.Matt Kean was involved in a sexting scandal in February 2018, texting Liberal MP Eleni Petinos to seek sexual intercourse while at the same time involved in a relationship with an adviser in Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's office, Caitlin Keage. Ms Keage subsequently shared the illicit text messages with the media, describing it as predatory behaviour by Kean. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian described Kean's conduct as extremely disappointing and Kean apologised in a media statement. This followed an earlier relationship scandal involving Kean in 2016, when a former partner said on Facebook, then retracted, that Kean had been \u201cscrewing\u201d one of Turnbull's advisers.Kean was sued for defamation by car dealer Bevin Clayton, who alleged Kean falsely described him as dishonest and untrustworthy in social media posts.Following the resignation of Berejiklian, Dominic Perrottet was elected as leader of the Liberal Party of New South Wales and sworn in as Premier. Kean was selected by Perrottet to succeed him as Treasurer of New South Wales, and was sworn in on 5 October 2021. In a December 2021 rearrangement of the Perrottet minister, Kean was appointed as Minister for Energy, and retained the portfolio of Treasurer.Kean has said that NSW, which currently generates 70% of its electricity from coal, can stop using coal-fired power by 2030, but environmental activists point to the continued approval of new coal mines in NSW as making this unlikely, and have argued that NSW will struggle to reach its target of net zero emissions by 2050.Kean has been described as a moderate Liberal, and is considered to be the leader of the moderate faction of the New South Wales Liberals.\n",

Before becoming an attorney, Kean was a member of the Heavy and General Construction Laborers Local 472 Union (a branch of the Laborers' International Union of North America) in Newark from 1984 until 1988. Kean served as an aide to State Senator John O. Bennett from 1994 through 1996. He served on the Monmouth County Environmental Council from 1999 to 2001 and on the Wall Township Planning Board from 2001 to 2002. Prior to 1994, Kean had been registered a Democrat.Kean is a resident of Wall Township where he lives with his wife Bridget and triplets born in July 2012. Kean formerly wrote a column titled \"Legislative Matters\" in The Coast Star, a weekly local newspaper in Monmouth County. His column typically contains news from the statehouse in Trenton, opinions on issues facing his district, and criticism of the state's Democratic Party.\nKean first took his seat in the Assembly on October 28, 2002, following his selection by the District 11 Republican County Committee members to fill the vacancy created by the death of Assemblyman Thomas S. Smith. Despite not having the endorsement of Monmouth County Republican Chair William F. Dowd and the district's other Assemblyman Steve Corodemus, Kean won the special convention vote winning a majority of the vote (113 votes) on the first ballot defeating Long Branch councilman Anthony Giordano (81 votes) and former Asbury Park mayor Carl Williams (13 votes). He would win election to full two-year terms in 2003 and 2005.\nIn the Assembly, he was the Assistant Republican Whip from 2004 to 2008. In his first stint in the Assembly, Kean served in the State Government Committee and the Transportation and Public Works Committee.In 2007, 11th District Senator Joseph A. Palaia opted to retire at the end of his term. Kean sought election to the seat and defeated former professional football player and Assemblyman John Villapiano 63%-37%. During the first two years of his four-year Senate term, he served on the Legislative Services Commission, Labor, and Transportation Committees. In the next two years, he was a member of the Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee and the Transportation Committee.As a result of the 2011 legislative redistricting, Kean's hometown of Wall Township was placed into the 30th Legislative District setting up a potential primary election with fellow Republican Senator Robert Singer. Kean avoided such a fight by instead successfully running for election to the Assembly alongside David Rible (who was one of Kean's Assembly successors). In his current term in the Assembly, he is on the Consumer Affairs and Regulated Professions Committees.\n",

Keane, while being a successful business man, was also an Irish tenor. Keane's brother, Geoffrey Keane, and his sister, Sheila Keane, are both musical as well. Keane grew up in Westport, Connecticut and played his first professional job as a rock n' roll musician when he was still a sixth grader. He studied privately with the late jazz pianist and Juilliard educator John Mehegan, and then with Czech composer Karel Husa at both Ithaca College, and Cornell where he attended school.\nKeane's studio is located in his first home in Monroe, CT which he bought in 1985, and converted into a recording studio in 1993. He married Susan St. Louis in 1987, who had a son, Chris Laskowski, born in 1971. They had their first son, Wylder, in 1987 and a second son, Dylan, in 1988. They lived at first in the studio they called \"Little Big Feet Studios\", after which the family moved to Newtown in 1994. Following his divorce in 2010, Keane commuted to the studio from Newtown for 15 years but eventually moved back in 2009. He has shared his home with actress, theatre producer and former high school classmate Bonnie Housner Erickson since 2015. Although he toured throughout the world in his early career as a guitarist, most of Keane's composing career has taken place at his studio in the woods of Connecticut, near friends that he has known for over sixty years in some cases. In an era where most television and film production took place in New York or Los Angeles, he was able to develop his substantial career simply through the notoriety and emotional power of his music.\n",

She was encouraged to become a graphic designer. However, she realized that she preferred developing and exploring visuals and stories. Her father Glen Keane was just starting to develop the story of Tangled and told her they would soon need a visual development artist. Keane and her husband moved to Los Angeles where she worked at Disney Feature Animation for ten years designing for Tangled, Frozen and Enchanted among other films. In 2012, she left to work independently. Keane's first children's book Once Upon A Cloud came out in 2015 and her second book, Little Big Girl was published in the fall of 2016.\nAs a conceptual artist during the production of Tangled, Keane's work spanned the visual development seen throughout the entire film, but her work was arguably most visible as the murals the character Rapunzel paints on the wall of her home. For these, Keane hand painted the mural on a wall in the art department of the Walt Disney Animation Studios. Keane also illustrated the Disney storybook, Rapunzel's Amazing Hair. In 2020, she won an Emmy Award for her work on Tangled The Series.\nFor Enchanted, Keane worked with costume designer Mona May to help realize Giselle's dresses. In 2013, Keane left Disney to focus on writing and illustrating children's books. She released her first illustrated children's book: Once Upon A Cloud, which Kirkus Reviews felt displayed her background in working for Disney.

            "early_life": "Keane was born in a small village called Sylane (near Tuam) in rural County Galway in the west of Ireland. From the age of four she was raised by her aunts Rita and Sarah Keane, also well-known sean-n\u00f3s singers. Keane started her singing at a very young age, due to the influence of her musical aunts. She made her first recording for Radio \u00c9ireann in 1958, at the age of five. This early start inevitably meant that Keane would have a career in music. Her brother, Se\u00e1n, also went on to enjoy a successful music career.\nKeane lived and worked in London for several years with Faulkner, before they moved to Ireland in the early 1980s. They worked on a series of film scores and programmes for the BBC and formed two successful bands, The Reel Union and Kinvara. During this period Keane recorded her first solo album, There Was a Maid in 1978. This was followed by two other releases, Broken Hearted I'll Wander (1979) and Farewell to Eirinn (1980), which gave credit to Faulkner. In the mid-1980s, she rejoined De Dannan and recorded the albums Anthem and Ballroom with them.\nKeane turned her attention, once again, to her solo career in 1988. It saw the release of the eponymous Dolores Keane album. Her follow-up album A Lion in a Cage, which was released in 1989, featured a song written by Faulkner called \"Lion in a Cage\", protesting the imprisonment of Nelson Mandela. It became Keane's first Irish number-one single, and she performed the hit at the celebration of his release. This exposure expanded Keane's reputation and popularity worldwide. A new facet was added to Dolores' career when she played the female lead in the Dublin production of Brendan Behan's The Hostage, a new translation by Niall T\u00f3ib\u00edn and Michael Scott, the opening night of which was attended by Mary Robinson, the President of Ireland at the time.\nIn 1992, Keane was among the many female Irish singers to lend their music to the record-smashing anthology A Woman's Heart. The album, which also featured Eleanor McEvoy, Mary Black, Frances Black, Sharon Shannon and Maura O'Connell, went on to become the biggest-selling album in Irish history. A Woman's Heart Vol. 2 was released in late 1994 and emulated its predecessor in album charts the world over.  Also in 1994, a solo album, entitled Solid Ground, was released on the Shanachie label (available on Dara Records) and received critical acclaim in Europe and America.\nIn August 1995, Keane was awarded the prestigious 'Fiddler's Green Hall of Fame' award in Rostrevor, County Down, for her \"significant contribution to the cause of Irish music and culture\". In that same year, she took to the stage in the Dublin production of JM Synge's Playboy of the Western World. Dolores contributed to the RT\u00c9/BBC television production Bringing It All Back Home (1991), a series of programmes illustrating the movement of Irish music to America. Keane was shown performing both in Nashville, Tennessee with musicians such as Emmylou Harris and Richard Thompson, and at home in Galway with her aunts Rita and Sarah.\nIn August 1997, Keane went to number one again in the Irish albums chart with a compilation album of her most loved songs. Another studio album was released by Keane in 1998, called Night Owl. It saw Keane returning to her traditional Irish roots and it did well in Europe and America. Despite a healthy solo career, Keane went on tour with De Dannan again in the late 1990s, where she played to packed audiences in venues such as Birmingham, Alabama and New York City.\nKeane has not released a solo album since 1998, stating that she wanted to take a hard-earned break after twenty-five years of relentless touring.\nKeane married musician John Faulkner, with whom she had worked on many occasions, in 1977. After a difficult pregnancy, Keane gave birth to their first child, Joseph. He was born with Bardet\u2013Biedl syndrome, which causes obesity and failing vision. Dolores and John's marriage ended in 1988.  Her current partner is Barry \"Bazza\" Farmer, with whom she had her second child, Tara, born in 1994. Keane put an end to recording and touring in the late 1990s, due to depression and alcoholism. She has received extensive treatment for these conditions. As of 2007, Keane lives outside Galway with her two children and her husband Barry. As of June 2014, Keane was given the all clear after developing cancer.\n",

Subsequently, he worked for The Irish Press. Later, he moved into broadcast journalism with Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann (RT\u00c9).\nKeane joined the BBC in 1989 as Northern Ireland Correspondent, but in August 1990 he was appointed their Southern African Correspondent, having covered the region during the early 1980s.

In May 2009 he won a Sony Gold Award for his Radio 4 series Taking A Stand. He also won a Peabody Award and an Emmy for his reporting as part of the BBC team covering the 2015 refugee crisis.\nIn the three-part documentary Forgotten Britain, serialised on the BBC in May 2000, Keane travelled across the country meeting people living on the edge in affluent societies.\nKeane was a patron of the UK-based development agency Msaada, which assisted survivors of the Rwandan genocide.\nIn 2010, he published his first history work Road of Bones: the Siege of Kohima 1944, an account of the epic battle which halted the Japanese invasion of India in 1944.\nOne of his projects is the five-part series The Story of Ireland, a 2011 documentary co-produced by BBC Northern Ireland and Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann.\nKeane has been awarded honorary degrees in literature from the University of Strathclyde, Bournemouth University and Staffordshire University.

            "early_life": "Keane was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of cartoonist Bil Keane, creator of The Family Circus, and Australian-born Thelma Keane (n\u00e9e Carne). He was raised in Paradise Valley, Arizona as a Roman Catholic.Keane's interest in art developed from observing his father's work as a cartoonist. (Keane's father based his Family Circus character of Billy on Glen's younger self.) To encourage Glen to draw, his father gave him a copy of Burne Hogarth's Dynamic Anatomy, and recommended he observe body forms and practice creative approaches to life drawing. \nAfter graduating from high school at Brophy College Preparatory in 1972, Keane applied to the California Institute of the Arts School of Art, rather than accepting a football scholarship to another college. His application was accidentally sent to the Program in Experimental Animation (then called Film Graphics), where he was mentored by Jules Engel.\nKeane left CalArts in 1974 and joined Disney the same year, where he spent three years working with veteran animator Ollie Johnston on the characters Bernard and Penny in The Rescuers. He subsequently animated Elliott the Dragon in Pete's Dragon, and the climactic bear showdown in The Fox and the Hound. \nIn 1982, inspired by the groundbreaking film Tron, Keane collaborated with animator John Lasseter (Toy Story, Toy Story 2) on a 30-second test scene of Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are, which was optioned for them by Disney executive Tom Wilhite. The test integrated traditional character animation and computer-generated backgrounds (Video on YouTube), and, like Tron, was a cooperation with MAGI. It was Disney's first experiment with digitally-drawn characters. Although the project was revolutionary (and became a predecessor to the famous ballroom scene in Beauty and the Beast), Disney declined to invest further in the featurette due to its cost.\nIn 1983, Keane left contract employment with Disney and worked as a freelance artist. He animated the character Professor Ratigan in Disney's The Great Mouse Detective; the \"Boys and Girls of Rock n' Roll\" and \"Getting Lucky\" in The Chipmunk Adventure; and the characters Fagin, Sykes, Jenny Foxworth and Georgette in Oliver & Company. \nHe became a lead character animator, one of the group of young animators mentored by \"Disney's Nine Old Men\". Keane animated some of Disney's most memorable characters in what has been called the \"New \"Golden Age\" of Disney Animation. He designed and animated the character of Ariel in the film The Little Mermaid (1989), and the eagle Marahute in The Rescuers Down Under. He was supervising animator for the title characters of the three Disney hit features Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and Pocahontas.\nWhile living with his family in Paris, France for three years, Keane completed work on Disney's 1999 Tarzan, for which he drew the eponymous character. He then returned to Disney's Burbank studio as the lead animator for John Silver in Treasure Planet. \nIn 2003, he began work as the director of Disney's CGI animated film Tangled (based on the Brothers Grimm story Rapunzel), released in November 2010, where Keane and his team strove to bring the style and warmth of traditional animation to computer animation. In October 2008, due to \"non-life threatening health issues\", Keane stepped back as director of Tangled, but remained the film's executive producer and an animating director.On March 23, 2012, Keane left Walt Disney Animation Studios after 37 years there. In a letter to his coworkers, he said, \"I owe so much to those great animators who mentored me \u2013 Eric Larson, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston \u2013 as well as to the many other wonderful people at Disney whom I have been fortunate to work with in the past nearly 38 years. I am convinced that animation really is the ultimate form of our time with endless new territories to explore. I can\u2019t resist its siren call to step out and discover them.\"He later said that one of the reasons he left Disney was his experience during the production of Tangled, which underwent several storyline and title changes. He felt that in a big studio like Disney, there were too many conflicting interests, with management pulling people \"in too many different directions\".In December 2013, it was announced that Keane joined Motorola's Advanced Technology and Projects Group to help its engineers create interactive hand-drawn animation. He released his first animated short, Duet, at the Google I/O Conference in San Francisco on June 25, 2014. It is the first hand-drawn cartoon made at 60 frames per second, and the third in a series of shorts, called the Spotlight Stories, designed to explore spatial awareness and the sensory inputs of a mobile device to create distinctive storytelling experiences. When Google sold its Motorola subsidiary in early 2014, Keane and  his group remained there.In 2015, it was revealed that Keane and 16 other prominent artists and filmmakers had been hired by the Paris Opera to work on their 3rd Stage project. \nKeane is the creator of the animated short Nephtali (a reference to Jacob's blessings and Psalm 42), on which he collaborated with choreographer and ballet dancer Marion Barbeau.In addition to his work as an animator, Keane has written and illustrated a series of children's books based on Bible parables, featuring the characters Adam Raccoon and King Aren the Lion.\nKeane directed the Chinese animated film Over the Moon, about a girl who builds a rocket and flies to the moon to meet a legendary moon goddess. Written by Audrey Wells, produced by Pearl Studio, and animated by Sony Pictures Imageworks, it was released on Netflix on October 23, 2020.At the 2018 Oscars, Keane shared the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film with Kobe Bryant for Dear Basketball, which was based on a poem Bryant wrote on his retirement.  On May 26, 2018 Keane received the 2017 Reuben Award for the Cartoonist of the Year  in his hometown of Philadelphia, PA.\nIn 1975, during the production of his debut film, Keane married Linda Hesselroth. They are the parents of design artist Claire Keane and computer graphics artist Max Keane.\nKeane has been cited among artists with aphantasia, a condition characterized by an inability to form mental images. He is a Christian.\n",

The Keane house in Dublin was a musical landmark on the traditional music scene in the 1950s and 1960s. Keane's mother and father were both fiddle players from musical communities in County Longford and County Clare, and would play host to the legendary players who traveled from all over Ireland to perform in the capital city. These guests greatly affected James and his brother Se\u00e1n Keane, the fiddler with the Chieftains, as did their summer trips to Longford and Clare where they encountered the music at its roots.\nBy the age of ten, James had become a fixture on the late 1950s Dublin traditional scene regularly performing with S\u00e9amus Ennis, Leo Rowsome, Sonny Brogan and Tommy Reck, honing his skills under their guidance.

The original idea was to represent her with other major figures in the Good Friday Agreement (Gerry Adams, John Hume and David Trimble), but four years of talks as to where the individuals should be placed ended with Trimble's withdrawal and the plan was abandoned.In 2004, he toured his show, The Inconvenience of History, internationally.  This was based on trips in liaison with Christian Aid to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He also worked on paintings about the 2002 Moscow Theatre siege, using documentary footage as a source: \"The process has continued my methods of developing the imagery with the aid of a computer, prior to committing paint to canvas in works both large and small scale.\"In 2006, 57 Hours in the House of Culture was a show at Flowers East gallery, London, and Sakharov Museum, Moscow, about the Chechen War.His more recent work, Guantanamerica, bases paintings about \"issues of representation and dehumanisation of detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay\" on low resolution internet files.In 2010, he became known for a commissioned portrait of the former Secretary General of the UN Kofi Annan.In November 2019, along with other public figures, Keane signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as \"a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world\" and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election.He is a visiting research fellow at Camberwell College of Arts.\n",

Keane also curated and programmed exhibitions and screenings including The New Pluralism exhibition at the Tate Gallery, with Michael O'Pray, in 1985.\nKeane has been an important influence on successive generations of artists in the UK as a teacher at Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design, London, where she was Lecturer in Film & Video since 1982 and Research Fellow from 2003 to 2012. According to Malcolm Le Grice, \"During the 1970s and \u201980s, the teaching of women artists \u2013 including Tina Keane, Anna Thew, Anne Tallentire, Joanna Greenhill and Pam Skelton \u2013was one of Saint Martins\u2019 major contributions to art education. Their influence helped create a lasting shift in the gender profile in British art, and Saint Martins in general maintained a committed concern for gender, ethnicity and sexual politics throughout the Thatcher years.\u201d Notable students who were mentored by Keane include Sandra Lahire, Sarah Turner and Isaac Julien.\nHer 1978 multimedia work, She, presented at the Hayward Gallery, London, in 1978 was an early example of performance that incorporated live video and slide projections. Transparencies of neon signs, poetry and images of shop windows featuring mannequins were projected on a wall before which Keane performed, while video of the performance played on monitors surmounted with neon texts. Keane has said that the work brought into play \"the actual and the recorded, the shop dummy, and the person, the illusion and the reality\"Transposition, first presented at the Museum of Modern Art, Vienna, in 1992, used the body as a screen with video projected onto the naked backs of men as they glide sideways standing on a travelator. Keane subsequently re-edited the piece into a double screen video installation for the inaugural Tanks programme at Tate Modern, London, in 2012.In 2015, Keane was one of the recipients of the 21st annual Paul Hamlyn Foundation Awards for Artists, the largest individual awards made to visual artists and composers in the UK.

            "early_life": "Kearney was born and grew up in Iowa City, Iowa. Her mother played flute. She started her journey with music in the Lutheran Church's Cherub choir. Kearney took piano lessons at the age of 5 and began playing bass in the 4th grade. She listened to her parent's rock and roll records from the 1960's and gained an appreciation of the Beatles' music. In high school, she played in the school orchestras and jazz bands and was in a rock and roll band. At 13, Kearney and her band, Metro Pilot, won a songwriting contest for a song called \"Live\" about the dangers of tobacco, where the prize was to perform the song in front of a live audience including keynote speaker and former United States Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. Bridget fronted the band playing electric bass and singing lead vocals.Recalling playing bass in the fourth grade, Kearney said, \"I just thought I would go with the bass that year and switch instruments the next year, but after I started playing bass and got to know it, I decided to stay with it. The cool thing is that if you\u2019re a bass player, there\u2019s always demand. There were points at which I was in 12 different bands.\" In interviews she recalls how her jazz band director in high school, Rich Medd, always made class fun saying, \"I was always excited to go to jazz band rehearsal and that is one of the reasons I\u2019m still playing music.\" Lake Street Dive's early 2023 \"Gather Round Sounds\" concert tour found Kearney returning for a sold-out show at Hancher Auditorium on January 24, 2023 with Mr. Medd and other local music educators joining as the horn section.Already an accomplished and devoted bass player at a young age, Kearney played electric bass through junior high school, after which she moved to jazz music and switched to an upright or double bass until age 35 when Kearney acquired a number of electric bass guitars and other gear which expanded her sound.Kearney's knowledge, skills and innate capacity for creativity took her to a much higher musical level while studying with Mark Urness, a versatile bassist, composer, and educator in Iowa City at the time who later moved to teaching at Lawrence University in Wisconsin. Her early bass influences were Paul Chambers, Charles Mingus and Charlie Haden.In college Kearney double majored, studying jazz bass at the New England Conservatory of Music and English at Tufts University. As a sophomore, she played with two bands she helped found: Joy Kills Sorrow and Lake Street Dive.\nKearney likes to play tennis and run to stay fit and raise money for her favorite charities. She often seeks adventure on the road, like bungee jumping in New Zealand, and is a master of chipology. Her first job, during college, was selling souvenirs at Fenway Park. She once held the one-game record for selling the most (105) foam fingers during a Boston Red Sox game and refers to this early career as her \"fall-back, in case the music thing doesn't work out.\"\n",

            "early_life": "The son of Sicilian immigrants, Anthony LoBianco was born October 19, 1936 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of a housewife mother and a taxi driver father. He attended the William E. Grady CTE High School, a vocational school in Brooklyn. There, he had a teacher who encouraged him to try out for plays, which is when he began to develop an interest in acting. After graduating high school, he attended the Dramatic Workshop, studying acting and theater production.\nLo Bianco was a Golden Gloves boxer and also founded the Triangle Theatre in 1963, serving as its artistic director for six years and collaborating with lighting designer Jules Fisher, playwright Jason Miller and actor Roy Scheider. He performed as an understudy in a 1964 Broadway production of Incident at Vichy, and the following year had a supporting role in a Broadway production of Tartuffe. From late 1965 through the spring of 1966, he starred on Broadway as Fray Marcos de Nizza in The Royal Hunt of the Sun.He made his film debut in The Sex Perils of Paulette (1965) before appearing as a murderer in the semi-biographical crime film The Honeymoon Killers (1970). He subsequently appeared as Salvatore Boca in William Friedkin's critically acclaimed action film The French Connection (1971), and later starred as a police officer investigating a series of murders in Larry Cohen's horror film God Told Me To (1976). From 1974\u20131976, Lo Bianco played a lead role in six episodes of Joseph Wambaugh's anthology television series Police Story in the mid-1970s, four times alongside Don Meredith. He also appeared in several Italian films, including the Lee Van Cleef-starring crime comedy Mean Frank and Crazy Tony (1973).\nIn 1975, Lo Bianco won an Obie award for his off-Broadway performance as Duke Bronkowski in the baseball-themed play Yanks-3, Detroit-0, Top of the Seventh. In 1983, Lo Bianco was nominated for a Tony for his portrayal of Eddie Carbone in Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge. He also won the 1983 Outer Critics Circle Award for this performance. In 1984, he had a supporting role in the action comedy City Heat, opposite Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood.Lo Bianco first portrayed the larger-than-life mayor of New York City Fiorello H. La Guardia (mayor from 1933\u201345) in the one-man show Hizzoner!, written in 1984 by Paul Shyre. Lo Bianco won a local Daytime Emmy Award for the WNET Public Television version of the play, which was filmed at the Empire State Institute for the Performing Arts in Albany. The play was subsequently staged on Broadway in 1989, where it ran for 12 performances. Lo Bianco appeared in several independent films in the 1990s: in 1995 as Jimmy Jacobs in the HBO biographical film Tyson, in 1996 as Briggs in Sworn to Justice with Cynthia Rothrock. He had a minor role in Nixon, directed by Oliver Stone. Lo Bianco continued his work on the life of LaGuardia in a revised revival of the play in 2008, titled LaGuardia. His third incantation of the mayor's life had a limited run off-Broadway in October 2012, titled The Little Flower. Lo Bianco purchased the rights to the play from Shyre's estate and has rewritten it a few times. He views the play as \"a vehicle to express my concerns for the public and political mess that we're in, which we continue to be in, I think, and try to relate answers to failure.\" He performed it in Moscow in 1991 shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union, and in 2015 he was scheduled to perform it in Italy. The show was staged at LaGuardia Community College in May 2015.A New York Times profile in 2015 reported that Lo Bianco was at work on a one-man show playing himself and a film script about his early life.\nLo Bianco was previously the national spokesperson for the Order Sons of Italy in America. His humanitarian efforts have earned multiple awards, including Man of the Year for Outstanding Contributions to the Italian-American Community from the Police Society of New Jersey; a Man of the Year Award from the State of New Jersey Senate; a Lifetime Entertainment Award from the Columbus Day Parade Committee; the 1997 Golden Lion Award; Humanitarian Award of the Boys' Town of Italy.Lo Bianco was married from 1964 until 1984 to Dora Landey. They had three daughters. He was married to Elizabeth Fitzpatrick from 2002 until 2008. He married his current wife, Alyse Best Muldoon, in June 2015.\n",

His parents immigrated to the Netherlands in 1937, and Lo-A-Njoe was born in Amsterdam later that year. He lived through the Second World War as a young child. From 1953 to 1958, Lo-A-Njoe studied fine art and painting at the Amsterdam Kunstnijverheidsschool (School of Applied Arts), a predecessor to the Gerrit Rietveld Academie.\nIn 1958, Lo-A-Njoe received the Koninklijke Subsidie voor de Vrije Schilderkunst (Royal Subsidy for Fine Art Painting) to encourage young promising artists. Later that year, he had his first exhibition at Caf\u00e9 Eijlders: a large venue at the Leidseplein in Amsterdam, which is famous for its artistic ambiance and clientele.\nDuring the 1960s and 70s, he made many study trips in Europe and lived in the United States and Suriname. He also travelled to India, Morocco, Mexico and the Caribbean for inspiration.\nLo-A-Njoe's art is present in museums worldwide: the Municipal Museum of Mexico City; Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam; Cobra Museum for Modern Art in Amstelveen; Kunstmuseum Den Haag in The Hague; Surinaams Museum in Paramaribo; het Cura\u00e7aosch Museum in the Dutch Caribbean; the state art collection of the Netherlands (Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed); among others.\nBesides having a presence in museums, Lo-A-Njoe's art can be found in many private  collections worldwide and is regularly put up for auction at prestigious auction houses such as AAG (Arts & Antiques Group) or Christie's and Sotheby's.\nLo-A-Njoe also works as a commissioned artist for private and public commissions.

        "Dennis_Lo": {
            "early_life": "Lo was born in Hong Kong in 1963. His mother taught music and his father, Wai-hoi Lo, who immigrated from Chaozhou to Hong Kong in 1946, was a psychiatrist and the former head of Castle Peak Hospital. He also has a younger brother.Lo attended St Joseph's College for primary and secondary schools. After secondary school, he was accepted by Stanford University for electrical engineering and by the University of Hong Kong and University of Cambridge for medicine. He selected medicine and decided to study abroad. In 1983, at the age of 20, Lo arrived at Cambridge, where he spent 2 years to complete preclinical medical training and a BA degree, and studied genetic cloning in his third.In 1986, he moved to the University of Oxford for his clinical training, in part, he claimed, thanks to Christopher Wren's architectural works at Oxford. Lo was at Christ Church College during this period.He first completed his BM BCh in 1989, and then a DPhil (during which he was at Hertford College) in 1994 and DM in 2001, all at Oxford. He was also a junior research fellow in natural sciences at Hertford College between 1990 and 1993, and the Wellcome Career Development Fellow in Clinical Medicine from 1993 to 1994.\nLo began his research career studying polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a molecular biological technique for rapidly generating millions of copies of a desired DNA sequence. He first heard about the technique at a lecture by John Bell, now Regius Professor of Medicine, at Oxford, and asked to learn the technique from Bell. Working with Kenneth Anthony Fleming, his future PhD advisor, Lo found the relatively new technique generated a lot of false positives due to contamination.Lo then wondered if fetal DNA was detectable in mother's blood. Using PCR, he detected the Y chromosome in a mother bearing a baby boy. During his PhD, Lo wanted to develop his research into prenatal diagnostic test, using fetal DNA from fetal cells in the mother's blood. This, however, was stymied by a number of factors, including low concentration of fetal cells, high false positive rate and the persistence of fetal cells after giving birth.After obtaining his PhD, Lo became a lecturer in clinical biochemistry and a fellow at Green College, University of Oxford (now part of Green Templeton College). He was also an honorary consultant chemical pathologist at John Radcliffe Hospital, the major teaching hospital for Oxford.In 1997, again using the Y chromosome as a marker in mothers bearing baby boys, Lo reported the presence of cell-free fetal DNA in most of the test subjects. This was after he read that circulating tumor DNA were detectable in cancer patients' blood plasma and switched strategy to search for cell-free fetal DNA in mother's blood.Lo, who by the time was married, returned to Hong Kong the same year with his wife, as the city was preparing its handing back to China. He became a senior lecturer in the Department of Chemical Pathology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in January 1997. In an interview years later, he called this discovery was like \"finding your car's engine somewhere other than under the bonnet.\"One of the first disorders for which Lo developed non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA was Rh disease, a type of anaemia that occurs when the foetus is Rh-positive but the mother is Rh-negative. Separately, Lo also detected fetal RNA in mother's blood, which indicated what genes were expressed. He then sought novel methods to isolate fetal DNA from mother's blood, which in 2002 came in the form of difference in DNA methylation between the mother and foetus.Lo's research into non-invasive prenatal testing was interrupted in 2003 by the SARS outbreak. An infected patient was treated at the Prince of Wales Hospital, the teaching hospital for CUHK Faculty of Medicine, turning the hospital into one of the epicenters in Hong Kong. His group was one of the first to sequence the SARS virus and to discover the existence of multiple viral strains.Lo returned to studying detection of cell-free fetal DNA after the SARS outbreak. In 2008, he reported the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS), which has a much higher throughput than traditional PCR and was a relatively new technology at the time. When used to detect Down syndrome, which is caused by an extra chromosome 21, this method was later shown to have a 100% sensitivity and a nearly 98% specificity, prompting its introduction into clinics in 2011.The next year, while watching a Harry Potter movie in 3D, the flying \"H\" reminded him of 2 homologous chromosomes and gave him an idea on how to sequence the fetal genome: to separately sequence the 2 halves of DNA that the foetus inherited from the father and the mother. For the father's half, they searched for DNA sequences present only in the father but not the mother; for the mother's half, they counted the DNA sequences from the mother to deduce the sequences inherited by the foetus, which would be found in excess in the mother's blood plasma. This discovery created a non-invasive method to detect fetal mutations. In 2013, his group showed that the fetal epigenome could also be determined from mother's blood plasma.Apart from non-invasive prenatal testing, Lo started investigating cancer diagnosis, profiling and prognosis from circulating tumor DNA using NGS in 2012, when he reported the genetic profiling of cancer in patients' blood plasma.As of October 2021, Lo is an associate editor of Clinical Chemistry.Lo is the co-founder of 2 biotechnology companies, both established in 2014. Using funding from the venture capital firm Decheng Capital, he co-founded Cirina with his longtime CUHK collaborators Rossa Chiu and Allen Chan. The company focuses on cancer detection with circulating tumor DNA. The company was acquired by GRAIL in 2017, which, in turn, was acquired by Illumina in 2021. The 3 of them also co-founded Xcelom, which commercialised their research in non-invasive prenatal testing.In the 2021 Hong Kong legislative election, Lo was a registered elector in the functional constituency of Technology and Innovation and the geographical constituency of Kowloon West. The State Key Laboratory of Translational Oncology at CUHK, with which he is affiliated, is also a corporate elector (an elector that is a legal entity, as opposed to a natural person) at the same functional constituency. As Lo is also a member of the Election Committee of Hong Kong, making him eligible to vote in the Election Committee constituency, he was one of the 41 voters who held 4 votes and whose voting power would be approximately 7,215 times of an ordinary citizen.\nLo is married to Alice Siu Ling Wong. They met each other while Lo was pursuing his DPhil at the University of Oxford, where Wong was completing her DPhil in semiconductor physics. They got married in 1994.As of 2016, Wong is an associate professor and the head of the formerly Division of Mathematics and Science Education, Faculty of Education at the University of Hong Kong. She is no longer on the faculty list as of 2021.It was reported in 2021 that Lo bought a flat at The Masterpiece in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong for HKD$210 million.Lo is one of the initiators of the Hong Kong Coalition, co-founded by two former Chief Executives of Hong Kong Tung Chee-hwa and Leung Chun-ying.\n\n\n== References ==\n",

She enrolled at Stanford with the intention of obtaining a PhD in Cultural and Social Anthropology, but left with a second master's degree.Malinda Lo was made a member of the faculty of the Lambda Literary Foundation's 2013 Writer Retreat for Emerging LGBT Voices, along with Samuel R. Delany, Sarah Schulman and David Groff.She resides in Massachusetts with her wife, Amy Lovell.\nLo began writing for the culture blog AfterEllen in 2003, and at one point served as the managing editor.Her first novel, Ash, was published by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers in 2009. Ash was a finalist for the William C. Morris Award, the Andre Norton Award for YA Fantasy and Science Fiction, the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award, and the Lambda Literary Award. Her second book, Huntress, was published by Little, Brown in 2011. It is set in the same fantasy world as Ash, which mixes East Asian and European influences; it too was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award finalist and for the 2012 Gaylactic Spectrum Award for Best Novel, as well as being judged a Best Book for Young Adults by the American Library Association. Her third book, Adaptation, was published in 2012. Reviewers at Kirkus Reviews and elsewhere have compared it favorably to the television program The X-Files. The X-Files was also the subject of Lo's graduate research at Stanford. A sequel to Adaptation, titled Inheritance, was published in 2013.A stand-alone thriller novel, A Line in the Dark, was published in 2017 and was named a Best Book of the Year by Kirkus, Vulture, and Chicago Public Library.In 2021, Lo released the book Last Night at the Telegraph Club, following a teenaged American-born Chinese woman coming to terms with her homosexuality during the McCarthy Red Scare in 1950s San Francisco, adapted from a short story she wrote for the 2018 anthology All Out: The No-Longer-Secret Stories Of Queer Teens Throughout The Ages. She has since written Notes from the Telegraph Club, a series of blogposts about her research for the novel, and described that she chose to use Chinese characters with footnote translations for when the characters are speaking Chinese to each other, partly because the romanization of Chinese was not yet standardized in the 1950s and \"Romanized Chinese of the 1950s was for the benefit of non-Chinese Westerners, mostly white people\" and partly to make clear the sense of insider versus outsider culture. Last Night at the Telegraph Club was well received, with Kirkus opening their review with \"Finally, the intersectional, lesbian, historical teen novel so many readers have been waiting for\" and Joanne Zou writing for Farrago that it \"struck a very personal chord with me. It is a book full of hope and love and community and gay people, some of my favourite elements in storytelling. I am glad this book exists and it made me glad that I exist.\" In May 2021, it was announced that Last Night at the Telegraph Club had earned Lo another ALA Best Fiction for Young Adults nomination. In November 2021 her YA Novel, Last Night at the Telegraph Club was awarded the National Book Award for Young People's Literature.Lo followed up Last Night at the Telegraph Club with a standalone companion novel called A Scatter of Light, which was published on October 4, 2022. A coming-of-age story, it is set in 2013, during the time same-sex marriage is legalized in California, a topic which is used to connect the two novels.\n",

She won the silver award for Most Promising Newcomer at the 1995 Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation.However, with personnel issues at Warner Music in 1996, her second album was delayed indefinitely.  It was finally released in 1997 with little promotion and was a commercial failure. She was then dropped by Warner Music Hong Kong.  Subsequently, Lo asked to be released from her management contract at Music Sense. However, a clause in the contract restricted her from appearing in any public performances for three years and forced her into hiatus. At this time, her radio DJ friends invited her to work at Radio Television Hong Kong behind the scenes as a receptionist and secretary until her contract restriction was over.  During this 3-year hiatus, Lo admitted to suffering from depression as a result of the turmoil.\nIn 2010, Lo appeared in an episode of the singing competition The Voice when contestant Penny Chan asked her to perform a duet with him during a round of competition.  He chose her power ballad signature song, \"\u6311\u6230\u8005 The Challenger\".  Her flawless rendition of the song garnered universal praise.  Judge Anthony Lun mentioned during his critique, \"I wish there are more singers in Hong Kong like Mimi.\"  Upon hearing this, Lo broke into tears. Lo then went on to thank the contestant for choosing her and her song as no one has sung her songs in 15 years.  Host Sammy Leung then asked the audience to go pick Lo's songs to sing at karaoke.\nHer performance on the show sparked public interest in her past singing career on Hong Kong's media forums.  Upon airing of the episode, \"\u6311\u6230\u8005 The Challenger\" hit number six on popular Hong Kong karaoke chain KKBox's song chart on 1 July 2010.

            "early_life": "Lo was born in Taipei on 20 July 1954 to an upper-class family. He complied with his family's wishes to finish medical school by graduating from the China Medical University in Taichung, but decided to abandon a career as a physician to pursue a singing and songwriting career.In 1982, Lo released his debut album Zh\u012b h\u016b zh\u011b y\u011b (\u4e4b\u4e4e\u8005\u4e5f), the title of which consists solely of grammatical particles from Classical Chinese. A ground breaking album that broadened the horizons of Chinese music and set a new model for Chinese songwriting, it spun off hits including not only the title song, but also \"Lukang, the Little Town\" (\u9e7f\u6e2f\u5c0f\u93ae), \"Love Song 1980\" (\u6200\u66f21980), and \"Childhood\" (\u7ae5\u5e74). Singing songs infused with brazen commentary on the social scene of Taiwan at that time and sporting sunglasses, his debut sparked buzz and heated discussion about the issues that his songs raised in Taiwan, such as Confucian pedantry and urban emptiness.\nHe followed with his next album in 1983, Master of the Future (\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u4e3b\u4eba\u7fc1), which features several songs: the title song which warns the listener of a future run by children without morals or humanity and \"72 Transformations\" (\u73fe\u8c61\u4e03\u5341\u4e8c\u8b8a), and \"Orphan of Asia\" (\u4e9e\u7d30\u4e9e\u7684\u5b64\u5152) which shares its title with Wu Zhuoliu's novel about the Japanese occupation of Taiwan.\nIn 1985, inspired by the success of the charity single We Are the World by USA for Africa, Lo wrote \"Tomorrow Will Be Better\" (\u660e\u5929\u6703\u66f4\u597d), a highly successful charity single of his own to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Taiwan's independence from Japanese colonial rule. It was ultimately performed by over 60 different artists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, including Tsai Chin, Chyi Chin, Chyi Yu, Sarah Chen, Eric Moo, Fei Yu-Ching, Angus Tung, and Jonathan Lee.\nLover/Comrade (\u611b\u4eba\u540c\u5fd7) was Lo's next album, released in 1988. In addition to the title song which uses political slogans in the context of a love song, the album also included \"Love Song 1990\" (\u6200\u66f21990), one of his most famous love songs that was written 6 years after he had written \"Love Song 1980.\"\nIn 1991, he wrote \"Pearl of the Orient\" (\u6771\u65b9\u4e4b\u73e0), regarded as one of his most famous songs which sings praises to Hong Kong as a symbolic haven from the perils of the Pacific and implores Hong Kong not to lose its Chinese identity in the face of rapid modernization and British colonization at that time. He also wrote \"Queen's Road East\" (\u7687\u540e\u5927\u9053\u6771), a Cantonese song he sang with Ram Chiang that satirizes the impending Hong Kong handover in 1997.\nIn 2004, Lo formally relinquished his US citizenship to protest the introduction to the US House of Representatives of a resolution regarding the deployment of Taiwanese marines to Iraq. \"[W]hen US representatives introduced a resolution requesting that Taiwan send marines to Iraq, I realized that while the US often stresses peaceful negotiations across the Taiwan Strait, the US government is the third party that stands in the way of truly peaceful negotiation,\" Lo said.On Sunday, 25 May 2008, at 7 pm PST, Lo held a live concert at San Jose State University Event Center. The concert, entitled \"Join 'N Sing\", was a celebration of the newly elected president of Taiwan, Ma Ying-jeou. There were three special guests at this show: Kao Ling Fung, Hsu Nai Ling, and Cindi Chaw Yong Hua. This show turned into a charity fundraiser for the earthquake victims of Sichuan, China.\n",

While growing up, Lo was captivated by his perceived difference of basic human needs in technology spending his time divided in big metropolitan cities and rural areas.  Having been introduced to the works of Claude Monet at a young age, he began to develop a fondness for fine arts.  \nLater, he had the opportunity to pursue his studies in US, where he developed an interest on conceptual and artistic depth of its advertising industry and contemporary arts.  Eventually enrolled in Art Center College of Design in California to complete a BFA degree in art direction.  It was during a fine art class and a visit to a lighting factory that inspired the artist to explore LEDs as an artistic medium.  After graduation, Lo moved to NYC to work in advertising and continued his artistic journey.  He had his first art exhibition at the Arturo Dimodica Gallery, NYC and since then, began working on lighting design projects.\nIn 2007, Lo moved back to Hong Kong and founded a LED experience design company LEDARTIST. He then earned his Master\u2019s degree on Lighting at Queensland University of Technology which led to a career in light art and design.  He has since participated in various international art exhibitions and large-scale lighting projects. Lo held exhibitions in prestigious locations around the world, including Luminale in Frankfurt, Asia Society in Hong Kong, Museum of Art and Design in NYC, Shanghai Museum of Contemporary Arts, Art Centre BUDA Kortrijk in Belgium, Hong Kong Museum of Art, Esplanade in Singapore, 798 Art District in Beijing and Burning Man Festival in Nevada, among others.

            "early_life": "Jim Loach was born in London to Ken Loach and Lesley Ashton in June 1969, one of five children. He studied philosophy at University College London.\nLoach intended to pursue a career in journalism. He joined the BBC where he worked as a researcher for Sue Lawley and Anne Robinson. He turned to directing in 1996 while working on the Granada TV current affairs programme World in Action. He went on to direct several episodes of Coronation Street in 2000, and subsequently directed episodes of Bad Girls, Waterloo Road, Shameless and Hotel Babylon.\nHis first feature film Oranges and Sunshine was released on 1 April 2011. The film starred Emily Watson as Margaret Humphreys, the social worker who exposed the scandal of child migration. It co-starred Hugo Weaving and David Wenham.In 2012, Loach directed Life of Crime, a thriller written by Declan Croghan. It centred on a young police officer's obsession with the killer of a young girl. Hayley Atwell played the lead part, supported by Richard Coyle and Con O'Neill. It transmitted on ITV to positive reviews in May 2013.In June 2015, Loach started production on his second film, Measure of a Man. Based on the coming-of-age novel One Fat Summer by Robert Lipsyte, the screenplay was written by David Scearce. The cast included Donald Sutherland, Judy Greer, Luke Wilson and Blake Cooper. The film was released nationwide in the United States on 11 May 2018 and sharply divided critics. \nMichael O'Sullivan from The Washington Post gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars and said, \"Measure of a Man is a funny, wise movie about bullying that speaks to kids and grown-ups alike\".[9] Richard Roeper at The Chicago Sun-Times gave it a 3.5 out of 4 stars and said, \"It's a sweet and knowing and lovely and funny story, but occasionally the spell of warm nostalgia is broken by painful moments of family heartbreak and cruel bullying\".[10] By contrast, Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle gave a critical review, describing it as a film of \"gestures and feints\".[12]  The film received its European premiere at the Rome Film Festival in October 2018.\nIn 2019, Loach directed Save Me Too, the sequel to Save Me, written by and starring Lennie James. The cast also featured Stephen Graham, Suranne Jones, Lesley Manville, Jason Flemyng, Kerry Godliman and Susan Lynch.\nThe series transmitted to very positive reviews in April 2020 in the UK on Sky Atlantic, and later on Peacock (streaming service), a division of NBCUniversal, in the United States, and Loach went on to win a BAFTA for Best Drama Series in 2021.\nWork on a second as-yet-untitled New Zealand-set film collaboration with Rona Munro is reportedly under way.\n",

        "Ken_Loach": {
            "early_life": "Kenneth Charles Loach was born on 17 June 1936 in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, the son of Vivien (n\u00e9e Hamlin) and John Loach. He attended King Edward VI Grammar School and at the age of 19 went to serve in the Royal Air Force. He read law at St Peter's College, Oxford and graduated with a third-class degree. As a member of the Oxford University Experimental Theatre Club he directed an open-air production of Bartholomew Fair for the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford, in 1959 (when he also took the role of the shady horse-dealer Dan Jordan Knockem). After Oxford, he began a career in the dramatic arts.\nLoach worked first as an actor in regional theatre companies and then as a director for BBC Television. His 10 contributions to the BBC's Wednesday Play anthology series include the docudramas Up the Junction (1965), Cathy Come Home (1966) and In Two Minds (1967). They portray working-class people in conflict with the authorities above them. Three of his early plays are believed to be lost. His 1965 play Three Clear Sundays dealt with capital punishment, and was broadcast at a time when the debate was at a height in the United Kingdom. Up the Junction, adapted by Nell Dunn from her book with the assistance of Loach, deals with an illegal abortion while the leading characters in Cathy Come Home, by Jeremy Sandford, are affected by homelessness, unemployment, and the workings of Social Services. In Two Minds, written by David Mercer, concerns a young schizophrenic woman's experiences of the mental health system. Tony Garnett began to work as his producer in this period, a professional connection which would last until the end of the 1970s.During this period, he also directed the absurdist comedy The End of Arthur's Marriage, about which he later said that he was \"the wrong man for the job\". Coinciding with his work for The Wednesday Play, Loach began to direct feature films for the cinema, with Poor Cow (1967) and Kes (1969). The latter recounts the story of a troubled boy and his kestrel, and is based on the novel A Kestrel for a Knave by Barry Hines. The film was well received, although the use of Yorkshire dialect throughout the film restricted its distribution, with some American executives at United Artists saying that they would have found a film in Hungarian easier to understand. The British Film Institute named it No 7 in its list of best British films of the twentieth century, published in 1999.During the 1970s and 1980s, Loach's films were less successful, often suffering from poor distribution, lack of interest and political censorship. His documentary The Save the Children Fund Film (1971) was commissioned by the charity, who subsequently disliked it so much they attempted to have the negative destroyed. It was only screened publicly for the first time on 1 September 2011, at the BFI Southbank. During the 1980s Loach concentrated on television documentaries rather than fiction, and many of these films are now difficult to access as the television companies have not released them on video or DVD. At the end of the 1980s, he directed some television advertisements for Tennent's Lager to earn money.Days of Hope (1975) is a four part drama for the BBC directed by Loach from scripts by dramatist Jim Allen. The first episode of the series caused considerable controversy in the British media owing to its critical depiction of the military in World War I, and particularly over a scene where conscientious objectors were tied up to stakes outside trenches in view of enemy fire after refusing to obey orders. An ex-serviceman subsequently contacted The Times newspaper with an illustration from the time of a similar scene.Loach's documentary A Question of Leadership (1981) interviewed members of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation (the main trade union for Britain's steel industry) about their 14-week strike in 1980, and recorded much criticism of the union's leadership for conceding over the issues in the strike.  Subsequently, Loach made a four-part series named Questions of Leadership which subjected the leadership of other trade unions to similar scrutiny from their members, but this has never been broadcast. Frank Chapple, leader of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union, walked out of the interview and made a complaint to the Independent Broadcasting Authority. A separate complaint was made by Terry Duffy of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. The series was due to be broadcast during the Trade Union Congress conference in 1983, but Channel 4 decided against broadcasting the series following the complaints. Anthony Hayward claimed in 2004 that the media tycoon Robert Maxwell had put pressure on Central Television's  board (Central was the successor to the original production company Associated Television), of which he had become a director, to withdraw Questions of Leadership at the time he was buying the Daily Mirror newspaper and needed the co-operation of union leaders, especially Chapple.Which Side Are You On? (1985), about the songs and poems of the UK miners' strike, was originally due to be broadcast on The South Bank Show, but was rejected on the grounds that it was too politically unbalanced for an arts show. The documentary was eventually transmitted on Channel 4, but only after it won a prize at an Italian film festival. Three weeks after the end of the strike, the film End of the Battle ... Not the End of the War? was broadcast by Channel 4 in its Diverse Strands series. This film argued that the Conservative Party had planned the destruction of the National Union of Mineworkers' political power from the late 1970s.Working again with Jim Allen, Loach was due to direct Allen's play Perdition at the Royal Court Theatre in 1987. In the play Jewish leaders in Nazi-occupied Hungary allow half a million Jews to be killed in pursuit of a Zionist state in Palestine. However, following protests and allegations of antisemitism, the play was cancelled 36 hours before its premiere.In 1989, Loach directed a short documentary Time to go that called for the British Army to be withdrawn from Northern Ireland, which was broadcast in the BBC's Split Screen series.From the late 1980s, Loach directed theatrical feature films more regularly, a series of films such as Hidden Agenda (1990), dealing with the political troubles in Northern Ireland, Land and Freedom (1995), examining the Republican resistance in the Spanish Civil War, and Carla's Song (1996), which was set partially in Nicaragua. He directed the courtroom drama reconstructions in the docu-film McLibel, concerning McDonald's Restaurants v Morris & Steel, the longest libel trial in English history. Interspersed with political films were more intimate works such as Raining Stones (1993), a working-class drama concerning an unemployed man's efforts to buy a communion dress for his young daughter.\nOn 28 May 2006, Loach won the Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival for his film The Wind That Shakes the Barley, a political-historical drama about the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Irish Civil War during the 1920s. Like Hidden Agenda before it, The Wind That Shakes the Barley was criticised by Ruth Dudley Edwards for allegedly being too sympathetic to the Irish Republican Army and Provisional Irish Republican Army, thought it would transpire that Edwards had not seen the film. This film was followed by It's a Free World... (2007), a story of one woman's attempt to establish an illegal placement service for migrant workers in London.\nThroughout the 2000s, Loach interspersed wider political dramas such as Bread and Roses (2000), which focused on the Los Angeles janitors strike, and Route Irish (2010), set during the Iraq occupation, with smaller examinations of personal relationships. Ae Fond Kiss... (a.k.a. Just a Kiss, 2004) explored an inter-racial love affair, Sweet Sixteen (2002) concerns a teenager's relationship with his mother and My Name Is Joe (1998) an alcoholic's struggle to stay sober. His most commercial later film is Looking for Eric (2009), featuring a depressed postman's conversations with the ex-Manchester United footballer Eric Cantona appearing as himself. The film won the Magritte Award for Best Co-Production. Although successful in Manchester, the film was a flop in many other cities, especially cities with rival football teams to Manchester United.The Angels' Share (2012) is centered on a young Scottish troublemaker who is given a final opportunity to stay out of jail. Newcomer Paul Brannigan, then 24, from Glasgow, played the lead role. The film competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival where Loach won the Jury Prize. Jimmy's Hall (2014) was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Loach announced his retirement from film-making in 2014 but soon after restarted his career following the election of a Conservative government in the UK general election of 2015.Loach won his second Palme d'Or for I, Daniel Blake (2016). In February 2017, the film was awarded a BAFTA as \"Outstanding British Film\".\nLoach lives with his wife, Lesley, in Bath. They have two sons, Jim and Stephen, and two daughters, Hannah and Emma. Another son died in a car accident, aged five. Jim Loach has become a television and film director. Emma is a documentary film maker who is married to the actor Elliot Levey.Loach is a patron of the British Humanist Association and a secularist, saying \"In particular, the indoctrination of children in separate faith schools is pernicious and divisive. I strongly support the British Humanist Association.\"\nLoach turned down an OBE in 1977. In a Radio Times interview, published in March 2001, he said: It's all the things I think are despicable: patronage, deferring to the monarchy and the name of the British Empire, which is a monument of exploitation and conquest. I turned down the OBE because it's not a club you want to join when you look at the villains who've got it.\nLoach has been awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Bath, the University of Birmingham, Staffordshire University, and Keele University. Oxford University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree in June 2005. He is also an honorary fellow of his alma mater, St Peter's College, Oxford. In May 2006, he was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship at the BAFTA TV Awards.\nIn 2003, Loach received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University and received the 2003 Praemium Imperiale (lit. \"World Culture Prize in Memory of His Imperial Highness Prince Takamatsu\") in the category Film/Theatre. In 2014, he was presented with the Honorary Golden Bear at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. The Raindance Film Festival announced in September 2016 that it would be honouring Loach with its inaugural Auteur Award, to recognise his \"achievements in filmmaking and contribution to the film industry.\" He was also made Honorary Associate of London Film School.\n",

She then attended Saginaw Valley State University and studied nursing for three semesters before deciding to focus full-time on her music career.\nIn 2011, Dej Loaf began her career as a hip hop artist. Her stage name is a portmanteau of a shortened version of her first name, \"Deja\", and \"loafer\", as she took a keen interest in Air Jordans when growing up. In 2013, she released her first official mixtape, Just Do It.. That mixtape attracted the attention of a fellow Detroit-native rapper SAYITAINTTONE. She was later signed to his indie record label, called IBGM (I Been Gettin' Money) under his management team. In July 2014, she released her track, called \"Try Me\" (produced by DDS), as a single, which earned her viral popularity.  Canadian hip hop recording artist Drake quoted lyrics from the song in his Instagram post. In October 2014, she signed a major record deal to Columbia Records. After signing the deal, she released her second official mixtape, called Sell Sole. The mixtape was given an \"A\u2212\" by music critic Robert Christgau, who wrote in his review for Vice, \"What's irresistible is the form-content disparity\u2014a rapper who brags so un-macho, a rapper whose greed is so explicitly for her family, a rapper who's 'Grindin' ' at music. Plus her flow is a brook, her producer respects her space, and her two sex rhymes are into it and into it more.\"Dej Loaf rapped on the song \"Detroit vs. Everybody\" featured on a fellow American high-profile rapper Eminem's compilation Shady XV (2014). In 2015, she opened for Nicki Minaj during the North American leg of The Pinkprint Tour. Later that year, she was chosen as part of the XXL magazine 2015 Freshman Class.In February 2016, Dej Loaf released a mixtape called All Jokes Aside. In July 2017, she released a joint mixtape with Jacquees titled Fuck a Friend Zone.After several years of delays, Dej Loaf split from Columbia Records in 2019. She then independently released her debut album, Sell Sole II on October 23, 2020. It features appearances from Big Sean, Gunna, Rick Ross, Lil Uzi Vert, and 6LACK. The album is the sequel to Dej Loaf's 2014 mixtape Sell Sole. The album holds a 72/100 rating on Metacritic, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"In February 2021, Dej Loaf was featured on Sevyn Streeter's single \"Guilty\" along with Chris Brown and A$AP Ferg.\n",

        "Mark_Loane": {
            "early_life": "The son of a judge who moved around Northern Queensland on judicial matters, Mark Loane was born in Ipswich, Queensland. He first attended Gympie Christian Brothers before being sent St. Joseph's Nudgee College as a boarder. He is married to Elizabeth Loane and has two daughters.\nLoane's senior rugby started in 1973 at the University of Queensland Rugby Club where he was coached by former Wallabies, Jules Guerassimoff and Chilla Wilson. State and national coach Bob Templeton was closely involved at the club. Loane came to Templeton's attention and was he selected aged eighteen to represent Australia when Tonga toured in 1973. He played in both Tests. The following year he made an appearance against the All Blacks.In 1975 he played in a Test match against Japan and in two Tests against a touring England team. He was selected that year to make the 1975\u201376 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland led by John Hipwell. Loane played in consecutive tour matches 1 through 4 but was injured in the game against London Counties and missed a number of matches including the Scottish and Welsh Tests. He played in eight straight games when he recovered, including the Tests against England and Ireland.In 1976 Loane played in all three Tests matches against the visiting Fijians and also captained Queensland against them. He was also selected for the short 1976 Australia rugby union tour of Europe under captain Geoff Shaw. Two years later when Wales visited Loane again captained Queensland against the visitors and played in two spiteful Test matches, both won. He made the 1978 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand and although Loane was in the incumbent Queensland captain, his state rival Tony Shaw was selected by coach Daryl Haberecht as the squad's captain. Injury restricted Loane to just two tour match appearances against Hawkes Bay and Manawatu.\nLoane's first Test as national captain was the 1979 Test against the All Blacks at the Sydney Cricket Ground which Australia won 12\u20136 to take back the Bledisloe Cup for the first time in 30 years. He also played against Ireland in two Tests and again captained the Queensland state side. That year the ARU showed full confidence in his leadership selecting him as squad captain for the 1979 Australia rugby union tour of Argentina, the first Wallaby tour to South America. He played in six of the seven matches including both Tests, for one win and one loss.His role in University's 1979 Grand Final victory will be remembered. The first Grand Final was drawn after extra time against traditional rivals, Brothers, and another match was scheduled for the following week to decide the victors. In all, 200 minutes of rugby had to be played before the victory could be celebrated. Once he had completed his medical studies in 1980 Loane relocated to South Africa to gain medical experience. He played rugby there in the Currie Cup and was selected as a junior Springbok. On his return to Australia in 1981 he immediately went into the Test team against France and captained Queensland against Italy.Howell asserts that Loane's career peaked in 1981 when at aged 27 he was selected under the captaincy of his state arch-rival Tony Shaw on the 1981\u201382 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland. Loane would captain the side in the Test against England when Shaw was dropped from the team following the Scottish Test. Shaw had retaliated recklessly to niggling from Scots player Bill Cuthbertson with a king-hit right in front of the referee. Shaw was to pay dearly for this as it would mark the end of his Test captaincy career. Loane also captained the side in four tour matches.Later that year Loane's stellar career came to an end after he captained Queensland and then Australia in two Tests against the visiting Scottish national side. All told Loane captained Australia for six Tests and seven other tour matches between 1979 and 1982. He captained Queensland in many matches against touring sides and in several distinctive wins over NSW from the late 70s until 1982.\nLoane graduated from the School of Medicine at the University of Queensland in 1977, before going on to complete his ophthalmology training in Queensland. He proceeded to complete Fellowships in both corneal transplantation and external eye disease (Flinders Medical Centre, South Australia) and in glaucoma (University of California San Diego, US). He has since performed more than 20,000 procedures.Loane is an ophthalmologist and practising surgeon in the Queensland public healthcare system, as well as the private system. He is a Fellow of both the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) and the Royal Australian College of Surgeons, and specialises in cataract surgery and glaucoma treatment. He works at the Surgical, Treatment and Rehabilitation Service in Herston. Loane practices in the private system through the Vision Eye Institute.Loane has been involved in a number of charitable organisations and works, including serving as Chair for the RANZCO Eye Foundation and as a board member for Guide Dogs Queensland. He also is the head of the Cape York Regional Eye Health Project, which provides specialist ophthalmic care to remote Indigenous communities in the Cape York Peninsula. The Cape York Eye Health Project was established in 1999 and visits 29 remote communities every year. Loane was awarded Membership of the Order of Australia (AM) in 2011 for his service to Indigenous health and to medicine through the project.\n",

From then, he began working on his magic skills, and at the age of 12, he won Taiwan's Youth Magic Contest, which was judged by world-famous magician David Copperfield. In an interview, Lu Chen said that \"This win was profoundly meaningful for me. It encouraged me to carry on my magic show dream. It showed me that my efforts could eventually lead to success.\"Despite this, Lu Chen did not expect to become a professional magician, instead choosing to study the Japanese language at Soochow University, while practicing amateur magic in his spare time. His failure to find a job after graduation forced him to pursue a career in magic. In 2001, Lu Chen expanded his magic shows onto television, starting a show called \"Magic Star\", quickly becoming STAR Chinese Channel's's most popular show.

She earned her Ph.D. in 2006, with a thesis entitled The Chemistry of Tris(phosphino)borate Manganese and Iron Platforms.Lu conducted postdoctoral studies at the Max Planck Institute for Bioinorganic Chemistry from 2006 to 2009, under the mentorship of Prof. Karl Wieghardt. Under Wieghardt, Lu studied first-row transition metal complexes synthesized with redox non-innocent \u03b1-iminopyridine ligands. Lu also reported the synthesis and characterization of a chromium iminyl radical complex, using the \u03b1-iminopyridine ligand system.\nIn 2009, Lu began her independent career at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities as an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry. She was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 2015, and full Professor in 2020.Her research focuses on the synthesis and characterization of bimetallic complexes, especially those that contain a metal-metal bond. The Lu group has developed a series of trianionic, tripodal ligands that can coordinate two metals at close proximity, allowing for the formation for a metal-metal bond in a coordination complex. The metal-metal bond order can range from bond orders of less than one to a quintuple bond, as between manganese and chromium in a complex reported in 2013, and between two chromium atoms in a complex reported in 2015.These coordination complexes are also active for catalytic reactions of small molecules, such as the silylation of nitrogen by a dicobalt complex, and alkene hydrogenation by nickel-group 13 element complexes.\n",

            "early_life": "Crowd Lu was raised in a household rich with culture and focused on the arts in Tainan City, Taiwan. His mother was a lover and collector of Western jazz records, which sparked a similar\u2014if not greater\u2014musical interest within Lu at a very young age. The glimmer of Lu's talent was apparent as he would belt out the songs of Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson only after listening to them once or twice.  Lu's grandmother also contributed to his musical versality. His grandmother was a fan of local Taiwanese dramas and would sing theme songs from these dramas to Lu and his sister to coax them to sleep. It was most likely at this time that Lu developed his signature style- carefree, sincere, and youthful.\nAfter graduating from the Tainan Guangming High School in 2003, Lu moved north to Taipei to attend Tamkang University. Although he intended on majoring in electrical engineering, due to his near fatal car accident, Lu was forced to switch his major to Spanish Literature.\nIn his first year at Tamkang University, Lu was run over by a bus and suffered severe injuries in both legs. As a result, Lu spent months in the hospital, during which he picked up the guitar and experimented with musical composition. The following year, Lu won first prize for musical composition and solo performance at a Tamkang University singing contest and proceeded to once again take the gold in composition and to become the crowd favorite at a similar contest at National Chengchi University. Lu caught the eye, and ears, of prominent music record producer Zhong Cheng Hu, and, with Zhong, produced three singles.  Of them, \"Good Morning, Beautiful Dawn!\" appeared on the Taiwan Musical Society's Top Ten Singles in 2007. By mere word of mouth, Lu sold 15,000 CD's of his singles.\nIn late 2006, for a little more than a year, Lu toured all of Taiwan, hopping from diners to universities, and created a huge following, especially among university students.\nIn 2008, Lu ended his tour with 100 concerts and, on 25 May, came out with his first CD 100 Ways of Living. Filled with the simple honesty of everyday life, 100 Ways of Living topped the charts and altered the course of the heavily Mando-pop musical industry and taste in all of Asia dramatically.\nOn 23 August 2008, Lu had his own first official concert, only 88 days after his hit CD came out.\nIn 2009, Lu's albums Seven Days (\u4e03\u5929) and Live in Taipei International Convention Center (TICC) were both awarded one of the Top 10 Selling Mandarin Albums of the Year at the 2009 IFPI Hong Kong Album Sales Awards, presented by the Hong Kong branch of IFPI.Lu performed the  theme song of the film Your Name Engraved Herein,  the piece won Best Original Film Song at Taiwan's Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards. As of August  2022, the music video has garnered more than 58 million views on YouTube.\n",

Later, Lu earned a degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University where he lettered in wrestling. He then received a doctoral degree in applied physics from Stanford University in 1989. Lu is a member of the Psi chapter of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity at Cornell.\nLu became a specialist in solar physics and did postdoctoral work at the Institute for Astronomy in Honolulu, Hawaii before being selected for the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1994.\nLu flew on Space Shuttle missions STS-84 in 1997 and STS-106 in 2000, in which he carried out a six-hour spacewalk to perform construction work on the International Space Station. Having been flight engineer on Soyuz TMA-2, Lu spent six months in space in 2003 as part of ISS Expedition 7, with cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko.In July 2003, Lu and Malenchenko answered questions from students participating in Japan's NASDA special educational event, where Ed Lu performed \"Happy Birthday\" on an electronic piano for a student's birthday in the live broadcast from space. He had demonstrated the difficulty of playing the piano instrument in space during a live in-orbit interview with CBS News and NASA TV video feed. Also on this ISS mission on 15 October 2003, Lu communicated with the crewman of China's first crewed mission into space, Yang Liwei, flying aboard Shenzhou 5. Lu congratulated the Chinese for the achievement and said in Putonghua: \"Welcome to space. Have a safe journey\". Malenchenko added: \"I love to have somebody else in space instead of (just) me and Ed\".While still employed at NASA, Lu co-founded the B612 Foundation along with former astronaut Rusty Schweickart and scientists Clark Chapman and Piet Hut.  It has conducted two lines of related research to help detect asteroids that could one day strike the Earth, and find the technological means for asteroid deflection. The foundation's current goal is to design and build a privately financed asteroid-finding space telescope, Sentinel, to be launched in 2017\u20132018. The Sentinel's infrared telescope, once parked in an orbit similar to that of Venus, will help identify asteroids and other near-Earth objects (NEOs) that pose a risk of collision with Earth.\nOn August 10, 2007, Lu announced he was retiring from NASA to work at Google.In June 2010, Lu left Google and worked out of the Sunfire Offices.  In September 2011, Lu joined Liquid Robotics as Chief of Innovative Applications, where his work includes outreach to promote new applications for ocean science, and in 2012, he joined Hover Inc. as its Chief Technology Officer.On June 28, 2012, Lu, with Apollo 9 Astronaut Rusty Schweickart and G. Scott Hubbard, Astronautics professor at Stanford University announced plans to build and operate the first privately-funded deep space mission called Sentinel. Their non-profit B612 Foundation will launch an infrared space telescope in orbit around the Sun, where from a distance as great as 270,000,000 kilometers (170,000,000 mi) from Earth, where it would detect and track asteroids and other near-Earth objects posing threats to the planet. On October 25, 2016 B612 and Lu endorsed NASA's NEOcam proposed mission and ended the Sentinel project.\nAs of 2022. Lu is working on a new project to find \"killer asteroids\" by analyzing terabytes of archived data. So far, the B612 Foundation, cofounded by Lu, has found over 100 new potentially-threatening asteroids. This immense number-crunching effort is supported in part by Google's applied artificial intelligence project. Additionally, he is currently married and has two children.\n",

He grew up in Bedford, Massachusetts, and started piano studies at age six with Dorothy Shi (\u6768\u955c\u948f) in the Boston area. Later on, he enrolled at the New England Conservatory Preparatory School, where he studied with Alexander Korsantia and A. Ramon Rivera. In 2013, he was admitted into the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where he studied with Jonathan Biss and Robert McDonald. He is also a pupil of Dang Thai Son.\nIn October 2015, Lu won the 4th prize at the 17th International Fryderyk Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw, Poland at the age of 17, becoming one of the youngest laureates in the history of the competition. Shortly afterwards, he performed his debut at the 70th International Chopin Festival in Duszniki, Poland. He went on a tour of Japan and Korea with the Warsaw Philharmonic along with the other prizewinners of the competition in January 2016. \nIn 2017, Lu won the International German Piano Award in Frankfurt. He also won the audience prize.In 2018, at age 20, Lu won the First Prize and gold medal at the Leeds International Piano Competition. He was the first American pianist to win since Murray Perahia. He played Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 4 in the finals with the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra conducted by Edward Gardner. After winning, he was immediately signed by Askonas Holt and Warner Classics. His first concert after winning Leeds was a debut with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and Vasily Petrenko. He subsequently made recital debuts at Wigmore Hall, Amsterdam Concertgebouw, Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, Saint Petersburg Philharmonia, and Shanghai Grand Theatre. His UK recital debut in Bristol was praised by The Guardian: 'Lu seems already to possess something of the magic touch of early Leeds laureates Murray Perahia and Radu Lupu'.In June 2019, Lu replaced Martha Argerich in a concert with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. Lu made his debut at the 2019 BBC Proms at London's Royal Albert Hall with the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra and Yu Long. In 2022, he stepped in on short notice to perform with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Riccardo Muti, replacing Maurizio Pollini; the Chicago Tribune noted Lu's \"perfectly idiomatic\" interpretation of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 27 (K. 595) and his \"pliant, gossamer touch\".\n",

At the age of fifteen, following Mao's death, China underwent economic change with the introduction of Western industrialization.\nIn 1980, Lu encountered photography while working in a silk factory in Yongkang. From 1987 until 1993, he ran his own photo studio. Later, he studied photography at the Fine Arts Academy of Tsinghua University (Beijing) from 1993 to 1995. He worked for several years on advertising assignments before going freelance as a reportage photographer. During his years of study at Tsinghua University, Lu encountered Xie Hairong, another Chinese photographer, from whom he gained inspiration to become a photojournalist.\nLu's work covers a wide range of consequences of China's rapid industrialization. A reoccurring theme is that of \"cancer villages\" in certain affected provinces, the negative environmental conditions (such as water pollution) causing these cancer villages and other related health issues, and the effect of industrialization on Chinese countrysides and its people. Lu has stated that his choice of subject in his photography is done to raise awareness in both China and on a global scale.\nShanxi province is the setting for a photograph within the series capturing severe birth defects present in the children living there. The province is also one of the most polluted areas in China. Beyond the Yellow River, Lu also documented pollution in the Yangtze River and the Qiantang River, with leaking sewage from the industrial districts. Heavy sewage and air pollution in Anyang City of Henan province is shown negatively affecting the lives of villagers.\nHis projects have included one on AIDS in the Chinese province of Henan as well as Pollution in China, Gold Rush, Drug Girl, and Development and Pollution.\nLu's photographs have been published in the National Geographic, The Guardian, and by Greenpeace. He lives in New York. Because of his reporting on social issues, Lu has faced attempts to stop his work.Lu is based in New York City, the first Chinese photographer to be invited by the U.S. State Department as a visiting scholar, and Beijing.In early November 2018, whilst travelling in Xinjiang, Lu was taken away by state security agents and has not been heard from since. A restrictive security regime with re-education camps for the predominantly Muslim ethnic Uyghurs and Kazakhs is in place in the region. Amnesty International is concerned Lu's detention may relate to this situation in the region and has called on the Chinese government to \"release him immediately\", and Human Rights Watch has called on it to \"immediately confirm and clarify\" his \"whereabouts and well-being\".In September 2019, Lu's wife Xu Xiaoli published on Twitter that Lu had been home for a few months.\n",

He attended Xi'an No. 85 High School. In high school, Lu played volleyball and was captain of the school team for three years in a row. In school, his favourite subjects were history and politics. He consistently ranked as one of the top three students in his classes.Lu joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1985 at 18 years of age. Due to his high grades, he was guaranteed entrance to the School of Economics and Management at Peking University. He was soon involved in student politics, and at age 20 was elected the head of the university student union, becoming the first student union president elected by popular vote since the Cultural Revolution. In early 1989, he gained admittance without sitting an exam to pursue graduate studies in economics at Peking University.While in graduate school, Lu worked under the direction of renowned Chinese economic Li Yining, who also taught Li Keqiang and Li Yuanchao. Lu also worked part-time as assistant to the manager of a wool production plant. By the age of 28, he was promoted general manager of the Beijing Wool Factory, directing the work of some 5,000 employees. While leading the plant, Lu shuttled between Xi'an and Beijing trying to win further business. He streamlined operations and increased revenue, turning the plant into a profit-generating business; the plant would eventually converted into a corporation. In 1998 he was named one of the \"Ten Outstanding Youth of Beijing\" for his work at the wool factory, and was received by then Premier Zhu Rongji.\nLu became head of the Zhongguancun Administrative Office in 1999, beginning his career in public administration. The Zhongguancun area of Beijing was known as \"China's silicon valley\", rich in start-up technology companies. In February 2003, he began working part-time as assistant to the chief executive of the Three Gorges Dam project. In January 2003, Lu was named vice mayor of Beijing, overseeing the city's Industry Work Commission and Economic Commission, overseeing the broad portfolios of state assets supervision, industry, and information technology.\nIn May 2008, Lu was named First Secretary of the Communist Youth League. He also served ex officio as the president of the China Youth University for Political Sciences. Prior to Lu, various political heavyweights, including former party leaders Hu Yaobang and Hu Jintao, and Premier Li Keqiang, had served in this position. At age 40, Lu became the youngest provincial-ministerial level official in the country.In 2009, Lu in his capacity as a member of the CPC Central Committee attended the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of Greece and personally met with its leader, Aleka Papariga.He was appointed acting governor of Heilongjiang on March 25, 2013, replacing Wang Xiankui, who had been promoted to Heilongjiang party chief. Lu was then elected as governor on June 5, 2013, during the second session of the 12th Heilongjiang Provincial People's Congress.\nIn 2012, Lu became the youngest full member of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In 2017 he remained the youngest full member of the 19th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.In March 2018 he was made Minister of Natural Resources in the central government.In June 2022, he was appointed party branch secretary of Development Research Center of the State Council, succeeding Ma Jiantang.\n",
