This was shortly after his parents had purchased their home in Gardena, California, where Jackson was raised along with his brother and sister. He was the youngest of the three. Prior to his father's death, he and his family lived in Los Angeles near the Chester Washington Golf Course. As a toddler, he had a series of ear infections which resulted in a tympanostomy tube. At age 17, Jackson was expecting a baby with his high school girlfriend. He worked various retail jobs and <<<sold his own beats in anticipation of supporting his only child>>> \u2013 a daughter who was born after they turned 18 \u2013 and her mother. Soon after, he began to sell drugs to support his family. Jackson was kicked out of his home by his mother after she grew tired of his disrespectful behavior. He stayed with various friends, including his daughter's mother; he also spent a period of time homeless. He  moved to the Watts area of Los Angeles and later settled in the Jordan Downs Housing Projects in Watts.\nJackson initially used the alias Greedy Giddy, under which he self-produced six mixtapes including the Bipolar series, Everybody Weak, and Money, Powder, Regrets. His early career was heavily influenced by Southern rap with auto-tuned harmonics and melodic trap instrumentals.

            "early_life": "Daniel Hernandez was born on May 8, 1996, in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York City to Natividad Perez-Hernandez, a factory worker and house cleaner from Atlixco, Puebla, Mexico, and Daniel Hernandez Sr., from R\u00edo Piedras, San Juan, Puerto Rico. His mother came to the U.S. in 1988 to seek a better life and opportunities. Hernandez played baseball and soccer throughout his youth and was allegedly assigned a scout for a major league team at 13 but his mother declined because she did not trust a stranger taking her son at a young age. Hernandez and his older brother, Oscar Osiris (born August 25, 1994), were <<<raised in a church throughout their youth>>>. Hernandez <<<sang during mass>>> and <<<was selected many times to read from the Bible>>>. His favorite passage was Psalm 121. His elementary school, was Public School 59. His middle school was Juan Morel Campos Secondary School. His high school was Legacy High School. He left high school around the tenth grade.Hernandez did not know his father until he was 9 years old and had only a brief relationship with him. Hernandez's mother told him he was dead, according to Hernandez's father. Hernandez's father had a heroin addiction and was in prison for five years for selling drugs. Hernandez's stepfather, who also was Puerto Rican, was shot dead steps away from the family home in 2010. After the murder of his stepfather, Hernandez's mother was not able to make enough money working to support her children. She applied for welfare and there were many nights Hernandez and his brother went to bed without dinner. Due to his mother's financial struggle, Hernandez and his brother wore used clothes and Hernandez had to share a bed with his mother.Emotionally disturbed by the death of his stepfather, Hernandez would not shower or eat to the point where he lost a lot of weight, he was given therapy and was hospitalized for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Hernandez also started to act out due to his stepfather's death and was eventually expelled from school in the 8th grade for bad behavior. Rather than continuing his education, he started working at various jobs such as being a busboy and a delivery boy at a grocery store to help his mother financially.\nHernandez first decided to rap in 2012 after meeting Peter \"Righteous P\" Rodgers, CEO of New York record label Hikari-Ultra, when he came into the vegan bodega Hernandez was working at in Bushwick, Brooklyn and asked if Hernandez rapped based on his appearance, stating that he thought he had the image of a rapper and suggested that he rap because of this, along with Hernandez' cadence.Hernandez began releasing rap songs in 2014, starting with \"69\" in August 2014, \"Pimpin\", in September 2014 and both \"Who The Fuck is You\" and \"4769\" in October 2014, the latter of which was his first collaboration as a lead artist featuring two rappers from the Brooklyn collective Pro Era, J.A.B. and Dirty Sanchez. Over the next three years, he released multiple tracks and videos with titles such as \"Scumlife\", \"Shinigami\" (named after the Japanese death god Shinigami from Death Note), \"Yokai\" and \"Hellsing Station\", drawing attention for his aggressive rapping style and use of anime as music video visuals. Many of his early songs were released by FCK THEM, a music label based in Slovakia. He adopted the stage name \"Tekashi69\"; \"Tekashi\" references Japanese anime, which he was a fan of, while \"69\" references both the 69 sex position and the yin-yang symbol.Gathering fame as an internet meme for his rainbow-dyed hair, extensive tattoos and rainbow-plated grills, he eventually became an associate of fellow New York rapper ZillaKami, the younger half-brother of Righteous P. They later feuded after Hernandez discovered Righteous P and ZillaKami were going to sign a record deal with Epic, in an attempt by ZillaKami to drop him due to a lack of control over Hernandez, alleged unpaid bail money, the surfacing of misconduct allegations against Hernandez, and a dispute over allegedly stolen instrumentals. Soon after Hernandez began working with Andrew Green a rapper known as TrifeDrew, again, who had previously worked with him on music videos to work on videos again along with music.\nHernandez can speak Spanish; he sang in Spanish on four tracks, \"Bebe\" and \"Mala\" with Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA in 2018, \"Yaya\" in 2020, and \"Bori\" with Cuban singer Lenier in 2023. Hernandez suffers from asthma.Hernandez was raised as a Christian. In an interview with American radio personality Angie Martinez, he stated: \"I pray a lot; I always thank God for good situations. Every time there's a good situation, there's a cell in my brain that says: 'Say thank you to God'. ... Before I blew up, for a year and a half\u2014400 and something days\u2014I literally prayed every day while walking my dog Titus. I would pray every day: God, please change my life ... God, please change my life; I'm a good kid. Please change my life. I got a baby; I can't even buy her Pampers ... please change my life, please change my life\u2014and then 'Gummo' came and life changed. And then I was like damn, God is real. I knew if I prayed every day it would work because God is real. And my life has changed.\"In March 2018, Hernandez conducted a radio interview on The Breakfast Club, alongside Australian pastor Brian Houston. In this interview, the pastor held hands with Hernandez and prayed for him; asking God to help Hernandez make wise decisions and to bless his family.At 18 years old, Hernandez had a daughter, who was born on October 29, 2015, with Sara Molina (born January 17, 1996). Hernandez has another daughter who was born November 19, 2018, with Marlayna M.\nA few weeks before Hernandez headed to prison at the end of 2018, he began dating Rachel \"Jade\" Watley. She has Hernandez's face tattooed twice on her body.On October 1, 2020, Hernandez was reportedly hospitalized after having an overdose from mixing two Hydroxycut diet pills with a McDonald's McCaf\u00e9 coffee. He has claimed that he came to weigh more than 200 lbs after leaving prison but has said that using the medication had helped him shed 30 lbs since he was released. His lawyer denies the overdose claim.In September 2022, Hernandez became the goalkeeper of the Russian media football team GOATS.In March 2023, Hernandez was reportedly assaulted inside a steam room at an LA Fitness gym in Palm Beach County, Florida. Videos of the attack were shared on social media. Hernandez sustained facial cuts and had to be hospitalized. No one has been arrested for the attack so far.\n"

He <<<began his musical career in his bedroom at his parents' house>>> in Rez\u00e9.\nIn 1995, Richard and Cambia released their first mixtape, Premi\u00e8re Formule. Recorded in a makeshift studio, the first self-produced cassette was sold in the courtyard of their school. In 1997, they associated with DJ Greem, a high school friend of Richard's, to form the group Hocus Pocus, and released their first album as a trio, Seconde Formule, in 1998. Hocus Pocus mixes elements specific to hip-hop (scratches, samples, rap) to an instrumental sound influenced by jazz, soul and funk. Alongside Hocus Pocus, they created in collaboration with DJ Atom and DJ Pfel, a group called C2C (also known as \"Coups2Cross\"). C2C was the world champion DMC team four years in a row from 2003 to 2006. They found the collaboration of two MCs and a DJ did not work on stage and went their separate ways; Richard continued his production as 20syl and DJ Greem invested specifically in C2C.In 2001, Richard worked again with DJ Greem and Cambia on stage as Hocus Pocus. The same year, they created the label On & On and released the maxi Sick, which sold around 4000 copies. Three years later, they released the album 73 Touches (in reference to the number of piano keys). Largely influenced by jazz, they refer to Miles Davis and Billie Holiday. Mathieu Leli\u00e8vre on keyboard, Herv\u00e9 Godard on bass and David Le Deunff on guitar complement the trio. The same album was reissued in 2006 with a new version of Sick and six new titles.\n\nThe album Place 54, released in October 2007, increased their willingness to create acoustic hip-hop. For this album, they signed with the label Motown France to promote and distribute it. The album was well received and attracted interest from mainstream TV and radio. In 2008, Hocus Pocus was nominated for a Victoires de la Musique award in the category \"Urban Music Album of the Year\".Richard published his first solo EP, Motifs, on the 9 June 2014; the site sourdoreille.net considers this EP as \"a real gem\" whilst wordplaymagazine.com praises Richard's style as \"frankly remarkable\". His second EP, Motifs II, was published on 11 May 2015. Regarding the cover of Motifs II Richard explains: \"For the first volume, I played on the contrast between the zebra and the checkerboard. For this one, I wanted another animal. I like animals with a solemn air, which release an aesthetic force. When I came across this owl, I found him mysterious and chic. I also chose the motif of the opposition in the checkered plumage. It is a way to symbolize the two aspects of my music: electronic and organic. This refined and enigmatic image raises questions.\"In July 2015 in Nantes, Richard presented the U, an interactive musical skateboard ramp (in collaboration with the collective Herrmutt Lobby). herrmuttlobby.com says regarding U \"The skater is the musician and the ramp is the instrument. He composes and decomposes the rhythm, he breaks down initial binary arrangements, making the digital human again for a moment.\" In September 2015 The Apple Keynote used a piece of Richard's music to promote the functionality of Siri on the Apple Watch in their \"Choose Colorfully\" advertisement. In late 2015, Richard published a remix of the PLPS song How I Feel. In January 2016, he published his first year production entitled Inertia.

His parents are both British nationals with Caribbean origins; his mother's family is from Dominica, and his father's is from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, while his paternal grandfather was Haitian. His father and twin sisters, dance choreographers Kyra and Jayda Davis, continue to live in London, where his father works for Westminster City Council.Abraham-Joseph's parents separated early in his life, and he moved at age seven with his mother to Atlanta, Georgia. In June 2005, at the age of 12, he returned to the United Kingdom for his uncle's funeral, stayed for a month, and then went back to Atlanta on an H-4 visa on July 22, 2005, which allegedly expired a year later. Abraham-Joseph's mother then began a relationship with Dr. Amsu Anpu, an endocrinologist and British expatriate, with whom she had more children. He had a brother Quantivayus (\"Tay-Man\") who died in a shooting after an attempted drug deal.In seventh grade, Abraham-Joseph was banned permanently from every school in DeKalb County School District for gun possession. This led him to begin attending schools around the Atlanta metropolitan area before being sent to a juvenile detention center. After being released from the juvenile detention center, he completed eighth grade through an alternative program before finishing a semester of high school, but dropped out in his freshman year following multiple exclusions that he said \"exhausted\" him. After dropping out, he joined a local street gang affiliated with the wider Bloods gang and became a full-time drug dealer, mainly selling cannabis. He also regularly took part in other criminal activities including robbery and car theft, although he was only arrested once after contraband was found in a car he was driving.

It is a tribute EP to fellow rapper and influence Gucci Mane. On December 1, 2015, 21 Savage released his second mixtape, Slaughter King.\n21 Savage and his mother are both adherents of the traditional West African religion If\u00e1.

            "early_life": "Noah James Shebib is the son of Lebanese Canadian film director Donald Shebib and actress Tedde Moore, who is known for appearing in the 1983 film A Christmas Story; she was pregnant with him during the production of that film. On his mother's side, he is the grandson of actor and educator Mavor Moore, the great-grandson of Canadian theatre figure Dora Mavor Moore, and the great-great-grandson of Scottish-born economist James Mavor. His father is of partial Irish descent. He has three older sisters, Zoe, Suzanna, and Chaunce. As a child he attended school at Royal St. George's College and Humberside Collegiate Institute.\nShebib began as a child actor, playing roles in television shows and films. His first role was in the 1996 \"Go Eat Worms\" episode of the Goosebumps television series.  He also played a consistent role on the Gemini Award-winning television series, Wind at My Back. His best-known role came in his teen years, when he was featured as one of the lead males in the critically acclaimed The Virgin Suicides. He also had smaller roles in The Last Don and Perfect Pie; the latter was his last movie before he retired from acting.\nEarly in Noah's career, before he started crafting beats, he DJ'd under the name DJ Chilly and performed alongside MC Elite (Everett MacLean). Shebib eventually made the shift from DJ to music producer, working with local Toronto artists like Empire, Knamelis, Stolenowners, and Christopher Morales, and Saukrates. He earned the nickname \"40 Days & 40 Nights\" (which was later reduced to \"40\") early on in his career, as he would work in the studio throughout the night, with no sleep.He began working with then Degrassi star Aubrey Graham (Drake) in 2005. He was shown producing with Drake on Degrassi Unscripted. When Shebib first started working with Drake, he was originally just a recording  and mixing engineer, providing no songwriting or production input at all. However, after the third day of work, Shebib decided to build an exclusive relationship with Drake, proclaiming that they were \"going to take over the world together.\"Shebib's big break came in 2009, when he executive produced Drake's mixtape So Far Gone with Toronto-based producer, Boi-1da. He recorded and mixed every song off the mixtape, and also produced a few notable tracks such as \"The Calm\", \"Houstatlantavegas\", \"Bria's Interlude\" and \"Successful\", all of which ended up defining Drake's sound going forward. He also worked on Drake's debut album Thank Me Later, and second album Take Care.  On the latter, Shebib co produced almost every song, alongside his usual duties of recording and mixing the entire album. Shebib also produced the song \"I'm Single\" from Lil Wayne's \"No Ceilings\" mixtape, \"Un-Thinkable (I'm Ready)\" for Alicia Keys and \"Demonstrate\" for JoJo.\nShebib, along with Drake and Oliver El-Khatib, founded the OVO record label in 2012. Music produced under the imprint is uploaded to the label's blog site for streaming, before the album is officially released. One example is the single \"Marvins Room\", which was first posted to the blog site five days after its conception, before it was even slated to be a single off the album. Recently Shebib has helped produce Drake's newer material, co producing the lead single \"Started from the Bottom\", among other records.Shebib also worked on Drake's third album, Nothing Was the Same, his fourth studio album Views, and Scorpion.\nIn 2005, at the age of 22, Shebib was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. His personal story is prominently featured on the National Multiple Sclerosis Society website, where he outlines his experiences with the disease, hoping that by creating awareness and \"improving connections and knowledge about MS, we can end the disease\". His mother was also diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  He was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws (LLD) from York University on October 12, 2022. Shebib has expressed public support for Palestine.\n"

He attended Denby High School in Detroit, Michigan, but later dropped out.  The numbers \"42\" in Dugg's name is a numerical reference to a local Crips LC set known as the Hustle Boys.  He met fellow rapper Lil Baby in 2017. He grew up listening to Yo Gotti and Jeezy. 42 Dugg is 5'1 in height\nHayes first gained traction for tracks \"The Streets\" and \"STFU\". After writing slam poetry with Lil Baby, he signed to Lil Baby's 4 Pockets Full (4PF) and Yo Gotti's Collective Music Group (CMG), in conjunction with Interscope Records. 42 Dugg received national attention when he was featured on Lil Baby's February 2020 track \"Grace\", peaking at number 48 on the Billboard Hot 100. He was also featured on Lil Baby's track \"We Paid\" in May 2020, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. This boosted sales of his mixtape Young & Turnt 2, peaking at number 58 on the Billboard 200 and number six on Billboard's Independent Albums chart. Hayes followed this success by doing guest features on songs for other artists such as Marshmello, Lil Keed, Meek Mill, Blac Youngsta, Big Sean, T.I., Kaash Paige, Tory Lanez and Latto.On February 21, 2021, a shooting occurred at Roddy Ricch and 42 Dugg's music video shoot, which left three people injured in Atlanta.

            "early_life": "The 45 King first gained fame with his breakbeat track \"The 900 Number\" in 1987. The song featured a looping of a baritone sax solo from Marva Whitney's \"Unwind Yourself\" (1968). The 45 King signed with Tuff City Records that year and was given a production deal. \"The 900 Number\" remains his signature work, having been resampled by many artists. He was also featured on the 1989-Hustlers Convention album on the UK label Music of Life, which is considered by many to be hip-hop's first-ever live album.\nUsing his popularity from the previous release, the 45 King was able to help the other members of his crew, dubbed the Flavor Unit, which included many well-known hip-hop acts including Chill Rob G, Lakim Shabazz, Apache, and Queen Latifah. The 45 King's big break came when Queen Latifah signed with Tommy Boy Records in 1989 and released the album All Hail the Queen. The 45 King did extensive production on this album, and it is considered by critics to be among his best production work. Over the next few years, many other Flavor Unit members also signed with Tommy Boy, and the 45 King frequently contributed to their albums with his productions. In November 1989, the re-release of \"The King is Here\" / \"The 900 Number\" peaked at #60 in the UK Singles Chart, his only appearance in a UK chart.In the early 1990s, drug addiction caused him to lose a production deal that he signed with Warner Bros. Records. Around this time the 45 King released multiple series of breakbeat records (the Lost Breakbeat series, the Breakapalooza series, etc.) and remixed Madonna's Top-10 single \"Keep It Together\", but he stayed mainly with his breakbeat record franchises.\nIn July 1990, Manchester-born DJ Chad Jackson sampled \"The 900 Number\" on his single \"Hear the Drummer (Get Wicked)\", which reached #3 in the UK Singles Chart. A remixed version was also a minor UK hit in 2007. Jackson was apparently unaware that the song had itself been sampled from the original \"Unwind Yourself\", as he credited himself, and King, as co-writers of the song.\nIn 1996, Washington, D.C.-based go-go artist DJ Kool had a hit with the song \"Let Me Clear My Throat\". It was a call-and-response vocals over a chopped half of the \"900 Number\" beat. DJ Kool did not just sample the track: he also acknowledged the 45 King as the song's originator, and the 45 King remixed the track for Kool.\nIn 1998, the 45 King produced \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\" for Jay-Z. The song was a hit that featured a looped chorus from the original cast album of the Broadway musical Annie. Jay-Z also did an interview when he spoke about how important the 45 King has been to hip hop music and considers him a true pioneer of the business. In 2000, he produced the platinum-certified track \"Stan\" by Eminem.\n"

            "early_life": "Jackson was born in the borough of Queens, New York City, and raised in its South Jamaica neighborhood by his mother Sabrina. A drug dealer, Sabrina raised Jackson until she died in a fire when Jackson was 8. Jackson revealed in an interview that his mother was a lesbian. After his mother's death and his father's departure, Jackson was raised by his grandparents.He began boxing at about age 11, and when he was 14, a neighbor opened a boxing gym for local youth. \"When I wasn't killing time in school, I was sparring in the gym or selling crack on the strip,\" Jackson remembered. He sold crack during primary school. \"I was competitive in the ring and hip-hop is competitive too ... I think rappers condition themselves like boxers, so they all kind of feel like they're the champ.\"At age 12, Jackson began dealing narcotics when his grandparents thought he was in after-school programs, and brought guns and drug money to school. In the tenth grade, he was caught by metal detectors at Andrew Jackson High School: \"I was embarrassed that I got arrested like that ... After I got arrested I stopped hiding it. I was telling my grandmother [openly], 'I sell drugs.'\"\n\nOn June 29, 1994, Jackson was arrested for selling four vials of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was arrested again three weeks later, when police searched his home and found heroin, ten ounces of crack cocaine, and a starting pistol. Although Jackson was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, he served six months in a boot camp and earned his GED. He has said that he did not use cocaine himself. Jackson adopted the nickname \"50 Cent\" as a metaphor for change. The name was inspired by Kelvin Martin, a 1980s Brooklyn robber known as \"50 Cent\"; Jackson chose it \"because it says everything I want it to say. I'm the same kind of person 50 Cent was. I provide for myself by any means.\"\nJackson began rapping in a friend's basement, where he used turntables to record over instrumentals. In 1996, a friend introduced him to Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC, who was establishing Jam Master Jay Records. Jay taught him how to count bars, write choruses, structure songs, and make records. Jackson's first appearance was on \"React\" with Onyx, for their 1998 album Shut 'Em Down. He credited Jam Master Jay for improving his ability to write hooks, and Jay produced Jackson's first (unreleased) album. In 1999, after Jackson left Jam Master Jay, the platinum-selling producers Trackmasters signed him to Columbia Records. They sent him to an upstate New York studio, where he produced thirty-six songs in two weeks; eighteen were included on his 2000 album, Power of the Dollar. Jackson founded Hollow Point Entertainment with former G-Unit member Bang 'Em Smurf.Jackson's popularity began to grow after the successful, controversial underground single \"How to Rob\", which he wrote in a half-hour car ride to a studio. The track comically describes how he would rob famous artists. Jackson explained the song's rationale: \"There's a hundred artists on that label, you gotta separate yourself from that group and make yourself relevant\". Rappers Jay-Z, Kurupt, Sticky Fingaz, Big Pun, DMX, Wyclef Jean, and the Wu-Tang Clan responded to the track, and Nas invited Jackson to join him on his Nastradamus tour. Although \"How to Rob\" was intended to be released with \"Thug Love\" (with Destiny's Child), two days before he was scheduled to film the \"Thug Love\" music video, Jackson was shot and hospitalized.On May 24, 2000, Jackson was attacked by a gunman outside his grandmother's former home in South Jamaica. After getting into a friend's car, he was asked to return to the house to get some jewelry; his son was in the house, and his grandmother was in the front yard. Jackson returned to the back seat of the car, and another car pulled up nearby; an assailant walked up and fired nine shots at close range with a 9mm handgun. Jackson was shot in the hand, arm, hip, both legs, chest, and left cheek. His facial wound resulted in a swollen tongue, the loss of a wisdom tooth and a slightly slurred voice; his friend was wounded in the hand. They were driven to a hospital, where Jackson spent thirteen days. The alleged attacker, Darryl Baum, Mike Tyson's close friend and bodyguard, was killed three weeks later.Jackson recalled the shooting: \"It happens so fast that you don't even get a chance to shoot back .... I was scared the whole time ... I was looking in the rear-view mirror like, 'Oh shit, somebody shot me in the face! It burns, burns, burns.'\" In his autobiography, From Pieces to Weight: Once upon a Time in Southside Queens, he wrote: \"After I got shot nine times at close range and didn't die, I started to think that I must have a purpose in life ... How much more damage could that shell have done? Give me an inch in this direction or that one, and I'm gone\". Jackson used a walker for six weeks and fully recovered after five months. When he left the hospital he stayed in the Poconos with his girlfriend and son, and his workout regime helped him develop a muscular physique.In the hospital Jackson signed a publishing deal with Columbia Records before he was dropped from the label and blacklisted by the recording industry because of his song, \"Ghetto Qu'ran\". Unable to work in a U.S. studio, he went to Canada. With business partner Sha Money XL, Jackson recorded over thirty songs for mixtapes to build a reputation. In a HitQuarters interview, Marc Labelle of Shady Records A&R said that Jackson used the mixtape circuit to his advantage: \"He took all the hottest beats from every artist and flipped them with better hooks. They then got into all the markets on the mixtapes and all the mixtape DJs were messing with them.\" Jackson's popularity increased, and in 2002 he released the mixtape Guess Who's Back?. He then released 50 Cent Is the Future backed by G-Unit, a mixtape revisiting material by Jay-Z and Raphael Saadiq.\nOn October 13, 1996, Jackson's girlfriend, Shaniqua Tompkins, gave birth to son Marquise. Tompkins later sued Jackson for $50 million in 2009, saying he promised to take care of her for life. The suit, with 15 causes of action, was dismissed by a judge who called it \"an unfortunate tale of a love relationship gone sour.\" The two have bickered for years, and have even taken their feud to social media many times.Marquise's birth changed Jackson's outlook on life: \"When my son came into my life, my priorities changed, because I wanted to have the relationship with him that I didn't have with my father\". He credited his son for inspiring his career and being the \"motivation to go in a different direction\". Despite this, the two have endured a fractured relationship that began when Jackson and Tompkins separated in 2008. Their feud has been taken to social media numerous times, including in 2020 when Jackson disclosed that he \"used to\" love his son. Jackson has a tattooed \"Marquise\" with an axe on his right biceps (\"The axe is 'cause I'm a warrior. I don't want him to be one, though\"), and has \"50\", \"Southside\" and \"Cold World\" on his back: \"I'm a product of that environment. It's on my back, though, so it's all behind me\".Jackson dated model Daphne Joy and had his second son, Sire Jackson, with her, on September 1, 2012. At the age of two years, Sire modeled for Kidz Safe, a headphone brand for kids, earning $700,000 through his contract.In 2005, Jackson supported President George W. Bush after rapper Kanye West criticized Bush for a slow response to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. If his felony convictions did not prevent him from voting, he said, he would have voted for the president. Jackson later said that Bush \"has less compassion than the average human. By all means, I don't aspire to be like George Bush.\" In September 2007, he told Time that although he would not endorse a candidate in 2008, he \"liked Hillary [Clinton]\".Six months later, the rapper told MTV News that he had switched his support to Barack Obama after hearing him speak, but had lost interest in politics. Asked his opinion of President Obama's May 9, 2012, endorsement of gay marriage, Jackson said, \"I'm for it ... I've encouraged same-sex activities. I've engaged in fetish areas a couple times.\" He had been criticized for anti-gay comments in the past.Despite having numerous songs that reference drug and alcohol usage, Jackson remains teetotal, citing a bad experience with alcohol as his main reason.Forbes noted Jackson's wealth in 2007, ranking him second behind Jay-Z in the rap industry. He lived in a Farmington, Connecticut, mansion formerly owned by ex-boxer Mike Tyson. Jackson listed the mansion for sale in 2007 at $18.5 million to move closer to his son (who lived on Long Island at the time). The mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut, declared October 12, 2007 \"50 Cent Curtis Jackson Day\", honoring the rapper with a proclamation and a key to the city. One of Jackson's New York homes, purchased in January 2007 for $2.4 million and the center of a lawsuit between Jackson and Shaniqua Tompkins, caught fire on May 31, 2008, while he was filming in Louisiana.In December 2008, he told the Canadian press that he had lost several million dollars in the stock market and, unable to sell his Connecticut mansion, had postponed Before I Self-Destruct because of the economic downturn. Jackson won a lawsuit in November 2009 against Taco Bell over the fast-food chain's use of his name without permission.Jackson endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He rejected an offer of $500,000 from the Trump campaign to make an appearance on the candidate's behalf. However, he endorsed Donald Trump in 2020, due to his dislike of Joe Biden's tax plans. A week later, he retracted his endorsement, saying on Twitter \"Fu*k Donald Trump, I never liked him\", and endorsed Biden.\n"

Prior to her music career, Balbuena wrote poetry.\nShake began her music career in late 2015, recording the songs \"Proud\" and \"Swervin\". Shake's stage name is derived from her affiliation with the 070 music collective; 070 coming from New Jersey's 070 ZIP Codes. By 2018, the 070 crew was noted to have 11 members including artists and producers.By 2016, Shake was earning hundreds of thousands of streams on SoundCloud. Soon after posting several songs on SoundCloud, Shake attracted the attention of Miami-based promoter and social media personality YesJulz. After hearing \"Proud\" specifically, YesJulz reached out to Shake on Twitter, quickly signing on to be her manager. Shake broke through with \"Trust Nobody\", released early in that year. In August, Shake collaborated with fellow 070 members Ralphy River, Hack, and Treee Safari on the single \"Honey\". The song featured production from frequent collaborators The Kompetition, a three-person production group. \"Honey\" simultaneously premiered on Complex and 1 AM Radio on Dash. Vibe commented that the track \"[sounded] tailor made to rock on dance floors everywhere.\"Also in 2016, Shake signed with Kanye West's GOOD Music label. GOOD Music found out about Shake through Julz, as she played some of Shake's music at a Yeezy fitting, interesting the label's president, Pusha T. After signing Shake, the label picked up her \"Trust Nobody\" track and re-released it in September. Shake spent October and November opening up for English rock band The 1975 during the American leg of their 2016 tour. On December 8, 070 released their first mixtape, The 070 Project: Chapter 1.\nProminently referenced in her music, Shake uses she/her pronouns when describing lovers. A 2017 Vogue essay on rising queer stars in rap music mentioned Shake being in a relationship with Sophia Diana Lodato. In a 2018 Pitchfork article, Shake said she doesn't like to put labels on her sexuality. \"I don't really identify myself as queer or gay or anything. I just like girls.\" She was in a relationship with singer Kehlani from 2021 to 2022.Since January 2023, she has been in a relationship with actress-model Lily-Rose Depp.\n"

            "early_life": "Born in New York City to West African parents from Cameroon, he was raised in the Eastchester section of the Bronx and later in West Hempstead on Long Island, where he attended high school. 88-Keys first <<<took an interest in hip hop after hearing>>> Prince Paul's <<<production on>>> De La Soul's 1989 <<<critically acclaimed album>>> 3 Feet High and Rising. In the early 1990s, 88-Keys <<<met rapper-producers>>> Q-Tip, Pete Rock and Large Professor <<<working as an intern at>>> West Hempstead's The Music Palace <<<recording studio>>>. It was <<<Large Professor who gave>>> Charles <<<his>>> 88-Keys <<<moniker after witnessing his skills on the>>> Ensoniq ASR-10 <<<keyboard>>>.Upon considering a serious career in music, 88-Keys's parents and older brother began trying to point him into the field of medicine because it was a more \"professional field\" and the music industry didn't seem like a lucrative move. After briefly attending Hofstra University and Queens College, 88-Keys <<<dropped out to pursue his dreams of being a record producer>>>. <<<His decision was fueled by an opportunity to record some tracks>>> with The Pharcyde who were <<<recording in California>>>. 88-Keys currently resides in Harlem, New York with his wife and two daughters.\nIn addition to his passion for music, 88-Keys has expressed his love for fashion, most notably Ralph Lauren. During an interview with Metro 88-Keys revealed that he has worn Polo Ralph Lauren every day for 16 years.\n\nI try to stay true to Ralph's vision. I don't want to bastardize his vision \u2013 no offense to the urban community \u2013 because we all know what happened to Tommy Hilfiger once the hip hop community embraced it. I'll walk out of the door dressed in loafers when everyone else is wearing Timberland boots. I definitely stand out. I'll tag along with Kanye on shopping trips and look at clothing by designers whose names I'd need to take French lessons to pronounce. He'll ask me what I think and I'll be like, whatever. I've turned down paying gigs because they've tried to dress me in clothing by other designers. Besides record shopping, the only other place I need is a Polo store. I'll go to Paris and they ll be like, 'here's the Eiffel Tower' and I'm like, 'whatever, where's the record store and the Polo store.\nAccording to the article, 88-Keys began wearing Polo Ralph Lauren as a Long Island high school student in 1992 when he developed a liking for its classic, preppy style. Since then, he's worn a complete look from the brand every day, without fail. His wardrobe includes over 700 Polo pieces.Since his days as an assistant engineer, 88-Keys has produced records for numerous artists including Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Kid Cudi, Macy Gray, Musiq Soulchild, Dejuan Lucian and Consequence. Recently, 88-Keys extended beyond his production credits to highlight his skills on the mic as MC, singer and collaborator, most notably on his solo debut album The Death of Adam released on November 11, 2008. Executively produced by 88-Keys's close friend Kanye West, the concept album tells the story of a man named Adam who has been murdered in a loft apartment in Harlem. In August 2008 a fifteen-track mixtape titled Adam's Case Files was released as a prequel to The Death of Adam. The album's first single titled \"Stay Up! (Viagra)\" was officially released through iTunes on September 9, 2008. In December 2008, 88-Keys was highlighted as Spin Artist of the Day. In 2009, 88-Keys worked in Atlanta with new female duo Addictive on a track for a forthcoming album.\nIn June 2019, 88-Keys announced that a song he produced titled \"That's Life\", featuring Sia and Mac Miller, had been approved for release by Miller's estate, and was released through Warner Records on June 20, 2019.\n"

            "early_life": "William Edward Graydon was born on 8 May 1989 in Oxfordshire. His father Ken, former music manager for Bee Gees member Robin Gibb, named Graydon after seeing a number plate ending in WEG from a hospital window. He grew up in Thame and attended Magdalen College School, going on to study at the University of Exeter, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in biosciences followed by a master's degree in sustainable development. Following the George Floyd protests in 2020, he set up a three-year scholarship for a high-achieving BAME student studying at his alma mater. He has dyslexia. He has a sister named Charlie working in the healthcare industry.220 Kid's stage name originated from a charity effort where he ran 220 miles (350 km), a distance corresponding to nine marathons, over seven days. The run was completed in 2013 on the Isle of Man in honour of Gibb and supported three medical charities. After moving to London, he initially used the stage name \"Willie the Kid\" (named after the cowboy) without realising it was already the name of an existing artist. He previously had jobs working for marketing company CPM Group, as a model in Singapore, as a carpenter, and at a Tesco grocery store.\nPrior to embarking on a solo career, Graydon went by the name \"William Edward\" and was a member of pop duo OMYO\u2014an acronym for \"Our Music Your Opinion\"\u2014alongside Tom McCorkell while living in Thame. The pair met on New Year's Eve in 2014 at the James Figg pub in Thame and made a bet to write a song together. They wrote a few songs over the span of several days, including \"Lady\", which was used in an advert by clothing retailer New Look. After being dropped by a major record label, they formed their own independent one; their debut single \"Days with You\" was released on Two Six Records in 2017, with its music video shot in New York City. Their first gig was supporting Drake at the Wireless Festival and their debut album was planned for September 2017.Graydon's first song as a solo artist under the moniker \"220 Kid\" was \"Lights\" in 2018, which was a shift from OMYO's urban pop to electronic music. Follow-up singles \"Pleasure to Love You\" and \"Let Me Stay\" both featured vocalist Chilli Chilton. 220 Kid signed with Polydor Records in 2019. His debut single with the label was \"Don't Need Love\", a collaboration with English singer Gracey, which was released in December 2019. The song went on to reach the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number nine in July 2020, and received a nomination for British Single at the 2021 Brit Awards. His follow-up single, \"Too Many Nights\" with Northern Irish singer JC Stewart, was released in September 2020, peaking at number 74 in the UK. He lists the Bee Gees, Timbaland, and Motown artists as a few of his musical influences.\n"

A July 2014 feature article in Rolling Stone Australia stated that he is \"legally blind in his right eye\", while his left eye is \"slowly deteriorating due to the degenerative eye disease Keratoconus\".On 18 July 2010, 360 was involved in a go-karting accident while celebrating his birthday with Sydney-based hip hop artists Bliss n Eso. His accident resulted in a torn artery, lacerated pancreas and a damaged scrotum. According to the rapper, \"It [scrotum] wasn't ruptured, but it was ripped open ... The first thing I checked once I woke up was I didn't need to use a colostomy bag. My sex life is intact. There's no sex appeal if you use a colostomy bag\".On 13 February 2012, 360 and Crystal Bale became engaged; the pair then separated on 24 December 2012.As of October 2014, 360 is listed as a supporter of the 'Oscar's Law' campaign, which seeks to raise public awareness about the detrimental effects of factory farming of companion animals. He also appeared in PETA's 'Ink not Mink' anti-fur campaign.360 and Bale promoted awareness of suicide and depression issues.

Even if you hate me, this has nothing to do with music\u2014please share this around so as many people as possible can see it\". In September 2012, Bale posted her video, 'A Message from Crystal', which Beats Factory's Robyn Morrison described as footage of Bale \"talking about how she has been affected by suicide\u2014multiple times ... [it] is sometimes hard to watch, but essential viewing\".On 8 January 2016, 360 posted a song named \"I'm Sorry\" to his Facebook page, which addressed his codeine addiction and subsequent overdose. His addiction resulted in him cancelling tours without notice. In the song 360 mentions how he didn't tell anyone because he felt like a burden. Because he was addicted to Nurofen Plus, the pills could be bought without a prescription.In September 2016, 360 announced that he was diagnosed with unipolar depression.As of 2021, 360 frequently livestreams himself writing rap lyrics as well as performing new material live for his fans. 360 also revived an old Australian hip-hop trend of \"rapper tag\" (which he started), encouraging fellow Australian rappers to participate in the rap challenge.\nHe also continues to promote his message of healthy living and mental health awareness through his livestreams.\n"

However, he was not available when she wanted to give him contact information. Fortunately, four years later, A-Lin met him again in a bar where she sang regularly. She was officially offered a singing contract.A-Lin made her debut in the world of music at the end of 2006, achieving rapid commercial success. She has been called the next A-Mei, who is an aboriginal singer of Puyuma descent. She also got the nickname \u5929\u751f\u6b4c\u59ec, meaning \"A Born Diva\". A-Lin was often quoted as saying that A-Mei is highly influential to her music and often covers A-Mei's songs in music shows and concerts. A-Lin has won numerous music awards and is extremely popular within Mandarin-speaking world.A-Lin has performed internationally and at a sold-out concert with Xiao Yu and Shin in 2012 at the Sydney Town Hall. It was her first visit to Sydney and people flew in from different cities just to see her.In 2013, with Avex Taiwan exiting the market due to overall poor sales from the records, all singers under Avex like Huang Li-ling were allowed to terminate their contracts early.After terminating her contract, A-Lin signed with her new label Sony Music. In December 2014, she released her first album after leaving Avex. This album was nominated for Best Mandarin Female Singer, making her fourth nomination without any win.In 2015, she participated in the third season of I Am a Singer and came in sixth on the finale held in March 2015. As a result, her singing ability was recognized by more people and provided a boost to her career.\nA-Lin is the youngest in her family. Her parents are Roman Catholics and love music. A-Lin's older sister is Taiwanese model Luji Huang, who entered the Super Star competition in Taiwan in July 2013 as an aspiring singer in her own right. In 2015, after A-Lin entered I Am A Singer, Lea became a contestant for 'The most beautiful harmonies' (\u6700\u7f8e\u548c\u8072). They also have an older brother, and A-Lin's cousin-in-law is her fitness coach and also a guitarist. A-Lin was extremely popular as a student and the confidence she gained from this led to her decision to compete in a 'Singing Strength Elite Rivalry Competition' [\u6b4c\u5531\u5be6\u529b\u7cbe\u82f1\u89d2\u9010\u6bd4\u8cfd]. She chose the hit song 'At least you are still there' [\u81f3\u5c11\u9084\u6709\u4f60], by Sandy Lam, and the competition allowed A-Lin to believe she had a future as a professional singer. In reference to talent shows being readily accessible to young people these days, A-Lin commented, \"I am impressed that there is now a Million Star-type of singing platform, which allows both everyone who enjoys singing and those who are talented singers a tough but realistic chance - an accomplished dream.\" They also have a brother.On 1 July 2007, A-Lin married Huang Kan-lin, a well-known Taiwanese baseball player. They have a daughter, Huang Qiaoyu. (A-Lin said: \"At the first time Huang Kan-lin requested a song \"How Do I Live\"  by LeAnn Rimes in her Tainan Pub Session. However, at that time because of his poor English, he wrote \u201cGood Do A-Lin \" on a piece of paper and then spelled the song in homophonic Mandarin. The implication was that he wanted to chase after A-Lin because of her rich lips. Eventually, Huang Kan-lin proposed to A-Lin successfully by a new recorded song \"\u611b\u60c5\u554f\u600e\u9ebc\u8d70 (How Love Will Go)\").\n"

While still a student, he <<<began painting graffiti on the walls of his campus>>>, as a protest against students' conditions.  He was eventually expelled by the University's principal following a disagreement over religious restrictions.After being expelled from the University, his graffiti activities in the city of Tehran increased. A1one was <<<the first person to start painting on the city walls>>>. Therefore, his name can be interpreted as \"Alone\" or \"First One\". A1one started painting walls in the late 1990s. He is the pioneer of the urban art scene in the Middle East. When he began, it was a time when nobody knew what graffiti was in his country. He had a very influential role in the rise of street art and stenciling within Iran. <<<Already involved in urban arts in general>>>, he <<<met the rapper>>>, Nima, in 2005, <<<who told him everything about the graffiti culture>>>, which <<<triggered>>> A1one's <<<desire to grow in that direction>>>. His first significant work was a painting under the Tehran-Karaj expressway called Searching for Friends.He started his street art project in 2003 and inspired his close friends at that time to also begin painting on the streets. Artists such as Elle, isba, K.T., and Magoi were the first people to join him in Tehran. With his public space art, he describes his view on Iranian society and puts himself regularly in danger.\n\"When I decided to do my painting on walls I bought some spray cans \u2013 at that time we had just some very low-quality colors in Iran. My first work was a very simple work titled \"searching for friends\" painted on a wall right next to the Tehran-Karaj expressway late at night. It was a frightening night for me\u2026 The next morning I got three calls from friends who recognized my style of painting. They were shocked to see my work on a public wall. My first stencil was a Munch's Scream Print on Art University walls and after that, experimented with many techniques and methods, but I continue with stencils, graffiti, and sticker art.\"\nIn 2007, he was invited to illustrate the cover of a book, Young and Defiant in Iran; a contemporary ethnographic work by Shahram Khosravi. In 2008, he was invited to show his work at the annual Melbourne Stencil Festival, taking 40 pieces of work with him to his first trip in a non-dictatorship country, thus experimenting exhibiting his artwork without the fear of reprisals for the first time.By 2010, A1One was an established name within Tehran's youth culture and a key figure in the emergence of Iranian street art.\n"

She <<<first became interested in music>>> when she <<<joined the light music club in high school>>>, where she <<<primarily played the drums>>>. Furuhara <<<was inspired by musicians>>> such as M.I.A. and T-Pain who she <<<heard after traveling to Canada as an exchange student>>> in 2008, and <<<by final year of high school she had begun composing songs>>>. Following high school, Furuhara attended the Kanda University of International Studies, where she spent up to 14 hours per day speaking English, and later a flight attendant school for Air Canada in Vancouver. She returned to Japan as Air Canada required at least three years of work experience, and worked as an English conversation teacher in Osaka. Furuhara <<<started creating music when she was 22>>> when she returned to Japan. <<<Inspired by the music she heard in Canada>>> and <<<having some experience using GarageBand>>>, she decided to <<<start>>> a Tokyo-based <<electropop band>> called Go Retro with her friend Shiori Ogawa in 2013. Her bandmate Ogawa played the drums and used a Kaoss Pad for their live performances, while Furuhara performed on the synthesizer. Furuhara decided to start singing as the band's vocalist, so that she could lessen the work that Ogawa needed to do. The band released two demos and performed concerts around the Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka areas, and received a development contract from a record label, where Furuhara was given vocal training lessons. After a year together, the band broke up, as Ogawa decided to return home to Osaka.Shortly after Go Retro's dissolution in 2014, Furuhara was approached by a DJ called Takuma, and together they formed the group Eemie, producing exclusively English-language music. Initially self-releasing electro/chillwave music on Bandcamp, the group debuted on independent label Maxtreme Records in 2015 with the single \"Carnival\", and were listed among AP Japan's 36 Bands You Need To Know 2015. Eemie performed at the Summer Sonic summer rock festival in 2015. In 2015, Furuhara met the psychedelic pop/rock group Tempalay, and was invited to perform as a live support member of their band. Furuhara toured the US, performing both as a part of Tempalay and as a member of Eemie in March 2016 (including a performance at South by Southwest). In August 2016 the band disbanded, performing a final concert on August 31, where the band also released their debut and final album.\nFuruhara began her solo career in February 2017 as Aaamyyy, after becoming a radio DJ on InterFM's programme Tokyo Scene, where she debuted her song \"8PM\". For her solo career, she decided to sing in Japanese, as a way to reach listeners more easily in Japan. Aaamyyy released her debut extended play Weekend EP in September on cassette, recording the entire release on her phone, using the iOS app Figure. This was followed by the Maborosi EP in February 2018, as well as a compilation release of this plus her debut EP, entitled Maborosi Weekend, which was her first widely distributed release in Japan.In June, Furuhara officially became a member of Tempalay, which lead to the band releasing the extended play Nante Subarashiki Sekai in September, featuring Furuhara as the band's synthesizer player, and as their occasional background vocalist. Aaamyyy's final of her three EP series, the Etcetra EP, was released digitally and on cassette in October.Aaamyyy began recording her debut album Body in October 2018, releasing it in February 2019. A concept album set in 2615, the release was inspired by Netflix television shows such as Black Mirror and Maniac (2018). The album featured collaborations with American musician Computer Magic, New York-based group JIL and Japanese group Paellas' vocalist Matton. Tempalay's third album With Love from the 21 Century was released in June, and was the band's most commercially successful work to date, reaching #30 on Oricon's weekly charts.In March 2020, Aaamyyy collaborated with musician Shin Sakiura for the song \"Night Running\", which was used as the ending theme song for the Netflix anime series BNA: Brand New Animal.In July 2022, Aaamyyy released her fourth EP digitally, entitled ECHO CHAMBER.\nFuruhara adopted the English name Amy while living in Canada.\n"

            "early_life": "Aabrekk made his debut for Sogndal in 1974 in the Norwegian Second Division (the third tier of Norwegian football). Except for a short spell at SK Brann, where he played a match in the Tippeligaen (the top division) in 1978, he played for Sogndal throughout his career and was a major contributor to their promotion to the Norwegian First Division in 1981. He scored Sogndal's first goal in that division, against Molde in 1982. He played a total of 133 league games from 1973 to 1982, including 22 matches in the First Division in 1982.\nAabrekk started his coaching career in his home county, Sogn og Fjordane, at lower-league clubs Eid, Sandane, and Stryn, before becoming head coach of Sogndal. In 1990, his first season with them, Sogndal was promoted to the Tippeligaen in spite of a 5\u20130 loss against Bryne in their first home match. He then served as head coach of Troms\u00f8 in the Tippeligaen from 1993 to 1995.In 1995, during a match against Bod\u00f8/Glimt, Aabrekk tried to stall for time by acting as if he were injured after he was run down by Bod\u00f8/Glimt's physiotherapist Truls Karlsen. Although uninjured, he was taken by ambulance to the hospital. In an interview with Verdens Gang, he excused his behavior by saying, \"I felt I was lying on the ground a bit too long, and I did not dare to get up so I stayed on the ground. I lay there and was thinking, 'What's going on?' It was not planned, and it was definitely not very smart. I would rather call it a blackout.\" This episode, according to the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet, was the third worst case of acting in the history of football.Aabrekk later worked for the Football Association of Norway as a coordinator for youth development in Western Norway. He also served as Nils Johan Semb's assistant coach for the Norwegian under-21 team from 1992 to 1998, and when Semb succeeded Egil Olsen as head coach of the Norway national football team in 1998, Aabrekk became assistant coach of the national senior team. At the same time, he worked as Kjell Tennfjord's assistant in Brann, and in the summer of 1998 he became their head coach. After leading Brann to the finals of the 1999 Norwegian Cup, where they lost 2\u20130 against Rosenborg, he received a one-year leave of absence to work full-time as assistant coach of the national team during their preparations for the UEFA Euro 2000 football championship. He resigned from his job at Brann without returning, because Brann had already hired Teitur Thordarson as their head coach and offered Aabrekk a position in their youth department, a job Brann claimed it was impossible to combine with the position of assistant coach of the national team.In 2002 Aabrekk joined Sogndal as Torbj\u00f8rn Glomnes's assistant coach and saved the team from relegation. On 17 September 2002 Haugesund announced that Aabrekk would join them as head coach on 1 December. In a match against Start on 19 October 2003, Aabrekk told referee Bj\u00f8rn Hansen that he was \"bought and paid for\" twice after Aabrekk was dismissed from the bench. He was at Haugesund until the end of the 2005 season, when he joined V\u00e5lerenga's coaching staff along with Egil Olsen and Petter Myhre. On 27 July 2007 Myhre resigned as head coach of V\u00e5lerenga and Aabrekk was appointed head coach as caretaker. Following two wins and a draw in the next three matches, V\u00e5lerenga gave him the job until the end of the season.In 2008 Aabrekk was hired by Brann as a scout. Halfway through the season, the club wanted Aabrekk and the assistant coach, Espen Steffensen, to switch jobs. Steffensen did not accept this and was fired, and Aabrekk became the new assistant coach of Brann, against the wishes of head coach Mons Ivar Mjelde. Following Brann's bad performances and local press criticism of the lack of cooperation between Mjelde and Aabrekk, Mjelde announced on 7 October 2008 that he would resign as head coach at the end of the season. At the same time, the club announced that Aabrekk would return immediately to his job as scout, a position he kept until the contract expired.Aabrekk was then hired as head coach of his old club, Sogndal from 1 January 2010, succeeding Karl Oskar Emberland. In his first season there, the team won promotion to the Tippeligaen, and in the next they avoided relegation. Following the 2011 season, Aabrekk retired. In his last match, he was named \"Best Sogndal coach ever\".Aabrekk was hired as manager for Aalesunds FK before the 2015 season, but sacked four matches into the season when his club was last in the league.\n"

Over the next five years Aacht developed his hybrid of music production and dance performance, gaining popularity within the UKs hip-hop and contemporary dance communities. \nIn 2013 Aacht moved to Ghana.\n"

            "early_life": "Aalbers' goal was to bring Vitesse from the bottom of the second tier, where the club was when he\nstarted, to the top 40 soccer clubs of Europe.\nAalbers developed the basic idea for the 'Gelredome', a stadium with a sliding pitch that can be moved out of the building. Later, the same system was applied in Gelsenkirchen (Schalke 04) and in Japan. Events such as pop concerts can be held without damaging the grass. Gelredome opened in 1998. It has a roof that can be opened and closed and is fully climate controlled. In the first season after the opening, Vitesse's attendance rose to 20,000, from less than 8,000 in the old stadium.\nAalbers financed the ambitions by making solid profits on the transfer market. Players such as Roy Makaay, Sander Westerveld, Nikos Machlas, Glenn Helder and Philip Cocu were sold for large sums of money. Others came to occupy empty player positions, such as Mahamadou Diarra and Pierre van Hooijdonk.\nVitesse ranked in the top 4 positions, made a profit and showed a solid balance sheet in the final years of his presidency.\nAalbers resigned on 15 February 2000, after the main sponsor, Nuon, threatened to pull the plug if he did not. Nuon, a public utility company owned by local authorities, had trouble explaining why it invested heavily in Aalbers' ambitious plans.\nThe successor was Jan Koning, the former chief of Sara Lee's Douwe Egberts. In a short period of time, Vitesse began to show negative financial results, due to poor deals on the transfer market. The club survived numerous financial crises, such as the last one in 2008, when debts were bought of, under the threat of bankruptcy.\nAalbers is currently a marketing expert and consultant in city and stadium development. He acts as a matchmaker in international projects. Aalbers and his wife live in Eerbeek.\n\n\n== References ==\n"

In the mid-1950s, he became acquainted with world-renowned photographers through foreign photo magazines and was influenced by new ideas. Aali held his first solo exhibition, including photographs with new perspectives and compositions, at the Culture Hall in 1963 and has since held several solo and group exhibitions. Having a close relationship with Iranian modernist painters and sculptors, he took a formalistic and modernist look at his work, emphasizing that photography was not a mere copy of reality. One of the significant innovations in Iranian photography was the creation of mosaic combinations of photographs that did not correspond to classical photography methods. He exhibited this collection of his works for the first time in 1968 in Seyhoun Gallery. Another part of his works includes documentary photographs, which simultaneously found a general and human face due to repetition and sequence. After the revolution, he spent more time on his painting experiences, which are generally hyper-realistic, and many of his works were done in the form of paintings on photographs. In 1997, many of his pictures were exhibited in the review exhibition of Ahmad Aali's works, and 2010, 2012, and 2016, he held solo exhibitions of his new and old works.\nHis work is in numerous public museum collections, such as the British Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), among others.\n"

According to Aalto, her parents had decided to give her the name Marja-Sisko if she had been born a girl, as they had hoped. She was preoccupied with the issue of gender from the age of three. Although her parents had wanted a girl, they did not accept her gender identity. For example, they were angry when Aalto, as a child, asked why she could not wear a skirt when all the other girls did.Aalto's coming out as a trans woman caused a great controversy in the Church. The bishop of Mikkeli, Voitto Huotari, commented that there is no juridical obstacle for Aalto continuing as a vicar, but predicted that there would be problems. In 2009, almost 600 members left the Imatra parish. In November 2009, Aalto returned to the job of vicar after spending a year on leave. In March 2010, she requested to be allowed to resign, due in part to the discrimination she faced.She was elected the notary of diocese for Kuopio by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in 2010.\nSince her resignation as vicar, Aalto has pursued a career as a writer of detective fiction.

She graduated from Morton High School in the Scott County School District in 1984. A few years later, she and her best friend <<<made a decision to move out west to pursue a singing/music career>>> together. The friend ended up getting pregnant and Boyd relocated to Oakland, California. It wasn't long after this relocation that Boyd <<<was discovered by producer>>> (and future husband) James Earley, and brought to MC Hammer's attention that Angie was a vocalist. Hammer is also the one credited with giving Boyd her stage name B Angie B, when Hammer said \"just be Angie\" one day.\nB Angie B sang on \"Pump It Up (Here's the News)\" from MC Hammer's Let's Get It Started album (the version re-released on Capitol Records in 1988), and she became a backup singer during his concert tours. During one tour, she briefly dated Mike Tyson. Her next opportunity came in 1989 with Hammer's female rap trio Oaktown's 3.5.7. She added her vocals to their rap song \"Juicy Gotcha Krazy\" from the album Wild & Loose, and appeared in the music video with the group. In 1990, she continued to perform background vocals for Hammer during his successful Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em album and tour period.\nIn early 1991, Hammer signed B Angie B to his Capitol-distributed Bust It Records imprint and soon her debut album was released, titled B Angie B. It was co-produced by Hammer and Felton Pilate, a former member of Con Funk Shun. In April 1991, the album debuted at number 11 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. It peaked at number 133 on the Billboard 200. The release of the album was led by the single \"So Much Love\", followed by two covers: \"Sweet Thing\" (originally by Rufus & Chaka Khan) and \"I Don't Want to Lose Your Love\" (originally by The Emotions). The latter was the album's biggest hit, reaching number 54 on the Billboard Hot 100. B Angie B toured with Johnny Gill around the time of the album's release.In July 1991, she began dating Tyson again, while on tour with several Bust It musicians. She would later become a prominent witness in Tyson's 1992 rape trial. She also appeared in the Kid 'n Play farce Class Act and sang on the soundtrack's title track \"Class Act (Work That Body)\", which was also released as a music video. Late in 1991, Boyd left Capitol Records. Boyd released a second album in 1995 on the Bust It label (with an independent distributor). She dropped the first \"B\" from her name, performing as simply Angie B. The album release was preceded by the single \"It's My Life\". Neither the album nor the single charted. Nevertheless, critics identified her as a forerunner of neo soul R&B, which became more prominent over the course of the 1990s and beyond. Alex Henderson of AllMusic noted: \"B Angie B did her part to bring soul music to a hip-hop/urban contemporary generation... She was doing that type of thing before the rise of Mary J. Blige, D'Angelo, Erykah Badu or Jill Scott.\"After 2000, B Angie B (then amicably divorced from James Earley) returned to Mississippi. Boyd had one child, a daughter, with Earley. Her 1991 solo debut B Angie B was reissued in mid-2005 via Capitol Records. It included a bonus DVD, along with previous releases with Oaktown's 3.5.7. In the summer of 2009, she released new music via her Myspace account (myspace.com/bangiebmusic), including a remake of \"Ring My Bell\". In 2013, B Angie B signed a recording contract with Monarchy Records, a division of the Spectra Music Group. Her most recent album \"Stronger Than Ever\" was released on April 22, 2013. This project is a collaboration with Italian DJs Max Mazzeo and Dirty Old Boyz.\n\n\n== References ==\n"

B-Real would use fictional stories telling of life-threatening experiences as material for the group's debut album, and subsequent releases.\nWhile working on their first album, B-Real developed his distinctive high-pitched, nasal rap style. Previously, he had rapped with something like his normal voice, but DJ Muggs told him that his rap delivery was boring and warned him that, unless he changed it, he would be overshadowed by Sen Dog. B-Real took inspiration from hip hop pioneer Rammellzee, who had occasionally rapped in a high-pitched voice. B-Real initially saw the high voice as a silly gimmick, but was surprised at the positive feedback he got for his new style and decided to keep going with it.Cypress Hill's self-titled debut album was a critical and commercial hit, selling 2 million copies, and their follow-up album, 1993's Black Sunday, was an even bigger hit, debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200 and eventually selling 3.4 million copies. They became the first Latin rap group to have platinum and multi-platinum albums, and remain the best-selling Latin rap group of all time. In a 2010 interview, B-Real stated: \"Fortunately I guess the fact we were able to achieve what we achieved, being Latino but without really exploiting that side of it, showed like a whole generation behind us how you could have that success without being labeled as just one thing. Because back in the day, when you were labeled 'a Latino rapper', the record companies would only try to market you to that Latin fan-base which didn't really exist yet!... So yeah, it feels good to see people recognizing us as some of the pioneers that opened the doors for a lot of these other Latino rappers to come through.\"Aside from Cypress Hill, B-Real has been involved in several other musical projects. In 1996, he contributed to the soundtrack for the movie Space Jam. In 2002, he teamed up with Mellow Man Ace and Son Doobie for the short-lived Serial Rhyme Killas, which released one 12\" single in 2002. The group recorded a full-length debut album, entitled Deluxe Rapture, but it was never released. B-Real formed a rap metal group, Kush, with Deftones guitarist Stephen Carpenter and Fear Factory members Christian Olde Wolbers and Raymond Herrera. According to B-Real, Kush is more aggressive than other bands in the genre. He was also previously a member of the group The Psycho Realm, and in 2007 announced that he would collaborate with Sick Jacken once again on a new album. He revealed in an interview that he plans on recording a \"vs.\" album with Cypress Hill member DJ Muggs.From 2005 to 2007, B-Real released three mixtapes as a solo artist: The Gunslinger, The Gunslinger Part II: Fist Full of Dollars and The Gunslinger Part III: For a Few Dollars More. He released his first solo album, entitled Smoke N Mirrors, in 2009. He was a guest artist on the Snoop Dogg single \"Vato\", from Snoop Dogg's 2006 album Tha Blue Carpet Treatment. In 2017, he was featured on the Hollywood Undead song \"Black Cadillac\" from the band's fifth album Five.\nFrom 2016 to 2019, he was part of the group Prophets of Rage, along with Chuck D and former members of Rage Against the Machine.\n"

B.o.B felt he had established a substantial career. \"I went and blew all of my money on fast stuff like a chain and ballin'. Soon I was broke again, but I learned two important things from it; make sure I save my money and that I was hooked on music. He continued performing at open mics and underground venues to perfect his craft. In 2006, because he was underage, B-Rich helped sneak B.o.B into Club Crucial, a night club owned by Atlanta-based rapper T.I. There, B.o.B performed a song titled \"Cloud 9\", a self-produced, spoken word-like ode to marijuana. In attendance was producer and industry veteran T.J. Chapman, chief executive officer (CEO) of TJ's DJ's. Chapman agreed to co-manage B.o.B, which only a month later led to B.o.B's signing with Atlantic Records and subsidiary imprint Rebel Rock, run by Florida-based producer Jim Jonsin. His first single for Atlantic, 2007's \"Haterz Everywhere\", reached the top five of Billboard's Bubbling Under R&B/Hip-Hop singles chart.

But to wear the inscription \"Je suis Charlie\", I would not have done it.\nIn 2017, Ba brought with Nicolas Anelka funding to a association created by K\u00e9mi S\u00e9ba, a Pan-Africanist and anti-colonial activist with several convictions for anti-Semitism. In August 2020, Ba called on football to condemn China's treatment of Uyghurs.On 26 June 2017, Ba co-founded with Eden Hazard, Yohan Cabaye and Moussa Sow an expansion North American Soccer League franchise, San Diego 1904 FC, to begin playing in 2018.

            "early_life": "Baack was born in Berkeley, California, which remains his home today. He <<<graduated>>> in 1964 from the University of California, Berkeley, <<<with a major in history>>>. At Berkeley, his advisor was Raymond J. Sontag, the well-known scholar in European diplomatic history, and was on the varsity track team running under the legendary Olympic coach Brutus Hamilton. He was later asked to edit a collection of Hamilton's writings and letters.Baack was an officer in the United States Navy from 1964 to 1969, and had three deployments to Vietnam during the Vietnam War. He <<<subsequently entered graduate school in history>>> at Stanford University. There he was a student of Peter Paret, the distinguished Europeanist, who greatly influenced his approach to the study of history. He received his PhD in 1973. His academic career began at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, where he was promoted and tenured, and became Vice Chair of the History Department. He also served as Head of the Area Studies Program in International Affairs and Business, Chairman of the University Libraries Committee and a member of the University Research Council. While at Nebraska, he was also a guest professor at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and was selected by the National Science Foundation as the U.S. Antarctic Fellow for 1979\u201380. During that year he participated in American research activities in Antarctica including the exploration of the Ellsworth Mountains. At Nebraska his major published research studies examined social and agricultural change in 18th-century Denmark, and Prussia's German and European policies and notions of German nationhood during the first third of the 19th century. The latter work has been called \"a remarkable scholarly achievement\" (Felix Gilbert), and the reviewer in the English Historical Review concluded \"Baack's outstanding study of Pre-March Prussia cannot be ignored by anyone interested in modern German history.\" (William Carr).After his work in Antarctica, he returned to the San Francisco Bay Area and, beginning a business career, accepted a position as the director of education at the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), at that time the nation's largest gas and electric utility. He subsequently held a number of executive positions at PG&E, including head of the community and governmental relations departments and vice president for corporate planning. While at PG&E, he continued to be involved academically, normally teaching a seminar each semester at either San Francisco State University or the University of California, Berkeley.During that period he was also active as a civic leader in the San Francisco area. He served as President of the Bay Area Economic Forum, a leadership partnership of governmental, business, university, environmental, community and labor leaders in the region. He was also Chairman of the Bay Area Defense Conversion Task Force charged with the challenge of dealing with the closure of twelve military bases in the region in the wake of the end of the Cold War with the attendant loss of over 250,000 jobs. He was the co-chair of the Bay Area Water Transit Task Force, and was asked to be the chair of the board of directors of the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement Program by the president of the University of California System, a program serving historically under-represented minorities in the California schools and universities. He was also appointed to the California Commission on the Management and Leadership of the Public Schools, the Director's Blue Ribbon Task Force for the California State Park System, the California Economic Policy Working Group of the California State Legislature, and the Regional Planning Committee for the Association of Bay Area Governments. He has served as a director or trustee for a number of organizations whose work focused on services for urban youth, education, economic opportunity for minority communities, and reducing poverty and homelessness, as well as for organizations such as the United Way of the Bay Area and the World Affairs Council of Northern California.In retirement, Baack returned to academic research and was a visiting scholar in the history department at the University of California, Berkeley from 2003 to 2011. His research interests and publications have focused on European scientific exploration in the 18th century.He has been married, since 1964, to Dr. Jane E. Baack, a retired professor of organizational behavior at San Francisco State University. He has two children, James, an information technology engineer at PG&E, and Sally, professor of strategic management, and chair of the management department at San Francisco State University, and four grandchildren.\n"

Despite good performances, including a 0\u20130 draw away to rivals Arsenal, he was unable to become the team's first-choice keeper, but finished his time at the North London club with a League Cup winners medal from 1999. Spurs played eight matches en route to winning the cup and Baardsen started three of those matches (Ian Walker started four and Hans Segers one).In 2000 Baardsen, seeking first-team football, signed for Watford for a fee of \u00a31.25 million.

When he was in high school, he became more interested in psychology, and he was an above average student, becoming able to attend college, where he pursued a career as a psychologist.\nEventually, he began losing interest in that career, <<<focusing>>> instead <<<on becoming an actor>>>. Caballero <<<began to study acting>>> at the Instituto de Arte Dramatico Juana Sujo.\nCaballero established himself in Caracas, Venezuela, where he <<<kept studying acting>>>, at the Instituto Nacional de Teatro de Caracas. He also <<<studied acting in the United States and Brazil>>>.\nIn 1971, Caballero made his film debut, acting in an Italian-Spaniard-French production, Il Corsaro Nero (\"Black Pirate\"). Caballero proceeded to act in more than seven theatre plays, and, in 1979, he appeared on Venezuelan screens for the first time, in a film named El Reba\u00f1o de los Angeles (\"Angel's Herd\"). In 1982, Flavio made his telenovela debut, acting in La Se\u00f1orita Perdomo (\"Ms. Perdomo\"). That soap opera was the first of seventeen soap operas produced by Radio Caracas Television that Caballero would participate in, including 1983's Leonela, 1987's La Intrusa (\"The Intruder\") and Mi Amada Beatriz (\"My Beloved Beatriz\"), 1988's Aventurera (\"Adventurer\"), and 2002's Mi Gorda Bella (\"My Beautiful Fat Girl\").\nPerhaps Caballero's most important career year was 1989, when he reached international fame starring in Amanda Sabater alongside Maricarmen Regueiro. Caballero played Ivan Moros in the soap opera. Amanda Sabater was an heiress whose father was Diego Sabater. However, and unknown to the two main characters in the soap opera, Diego was really Ivan's father and not Amanda's. This soap opera reached high ratings in many countries, including Mexico, Puerto Rico and (among Hispanics) in the United States.\nCaballero is currently under contract with RCN Television of Colombia.\n"

Within months, the singles \"Feel\" and \"Listen\" were being played out by Timo Maas, Sasha, John Digweed, Chris Fortier, Danny Howells, and a host of other leading DJs. \"Feel\" was also selected by Dave Seaman for his Global Underground \"Buenos Aires\" compilation and, within months, the D:Fuse name was known in the worldwide dance music scene.\nIn 1998, D:Fuse was signed to the electronic music label Moonshine Records, releasing three mix compilations and selling well over 120,000 CDs and singles on the imprint including his first solo club hit \"Body Shock\". In 2001, D:Fuse was plucked out of the Lone Star State for his DJ skills, by Paul Oakenfold. Two consecutive North American 'Perfecto' tours comprising over 50 sold-out dates ensued, plus DJ appearances in England, Scotland, Switzerland, Ibiza, Canada and Mexico. This was followed up with a double CD mix compilation for Oakenfold's \"Perfecto Presents...\" series (in conjunction with V2 Records in the USA). \"People\" was released in February 2002 and immediately entered the CMJ Chart at number 9. Perfecto subsequently released \"She Rides\" by D:Fuse & Joy. This track appeared on numerous Perfecto compilations as well as the Gatecrasher mix series, achieving combined sales of over 200,000 units.D:Fuse released \"People_2: Both Sides Of The Picture\", a 2xCD mix for System Recordings, in 2003. This compilation proved to be one of D:Fuse's most successful works to date, and further established his name as a producer, since this release featured eight new D:Fuse productions. He was featured on the cover of both REMIX and URB magazines, and joined the select list of performers at the legendary Coachella Festival that same year.\nIn 2004, D:Fuse was voted URB magazine's #2 Winter Music Conference DJ. He also released his debut artist album \"Begin\" on System Recordings to much positive acclaim. Splitting recording time between England, Los Angeles and Chicago to create a varied musical landscape, \"Begin\" broke new boundaries. D:Fuse's signature fusion of electronic programming and organic instrumentation, coupled with its inspired lyric writing and vocals, re-wrote all the rules of the DJ 'artist album'. This long-awaited debut received 4 star reviews across the board in the industry media, and the single release \"Living The Dream\" (featuring Jes of Motorcycle) achieved combined compilation sales in excess of 140,000 units.\"Begin\" finally provided D:Fuse with the artistic space he needed to carefully experiment with - and skillfully integrate - musical themes that had influenced him, and his unique sound, over the years: from lush downtempo to driving basslines, funky percussion, and memorable melodies. Accordingly, his live shows began attracting more varied audiences since his music was proving to be equally palatable to both house and progressive music aficionados. The accompanying \"Begin\" tour was a massive success and hit 75 cities throughout North and South America.\nIn 2005 D:Fuse saw his fan base grow significantly, being voted one of the Top 15 progressive DJs in North America per the influential BPM/djmixed.com poll. D:Fuse soon teamed up with Mike Hiratzka to produce what would become one of the year's most sought after remixes: \"The Days Of Swine And Roses\", originally recorded by My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult. This became the biggest selling single release from the popular \"My Life Remixed\" CD - a compilation of Thrill Kill Kult classic tracks remixed by various artists.\nD:Fuse has always been a true innovator on the club scene, fusing live instrumentation with DJing in the form of live percussion for the past six years. In 2005 he unveiled \"The D:Fuse Live Experience\", a DJ/live instrumentation hybrid featuring D:Fuse on a full percussion set up, Mike Hiratzka on guitar, bass, keyboards and vocals, plus vocals by MC Flint. The show coincided with the live CD release of \"People_3\" on Moist Music, recorded at clubs in San Francisco, CA and Austin, TX. The CD produced top reviews in REMIX and M3 magazines and on countless websites. The D:Fuse live tour was well received nationwide with capacity events in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Austin, Dallas, New York City, Kansas City, and a headlining slot at Miami's 2006 ULTRA Music Fest.\nD:Fuse's live show concept led to a team-up with The Scumfrog in 2006 to create their much-hailed project \"DJs Are Alive\" alongside DJ Skribble, Kristine W and Static Revenger. The project continued to spark the idea that DJ sets can inspire so much more, both audibly and visually.\nIn 2006 D:Fuse relocated to Los Angeles to launch a new record label (Lost Angeles Recordings), and produce a full-length album, with his new production partner Mike Hiratzka. A full year of intense studio sessions produced \"Skyline Lounge,\" D:Fuse and Hiratzka's most ambitious work to date. The album delved even further into the use of live instrumentation with guitars, bass and percussion. It also included violins by Govinda of 18th St.. Records fame, and featured guest vocal performances by Kristy Thirsk (Delerium) and DJ Rap, plus vocal performances by D:Fuse and Hiratzka themselves. \"Skyline Lounge\" stayed in the top 15 on the iTunes electronica chart five weeks in a row and was a heavy rotation pick on XM/Sirius chill, Below Zero FM in San Francisco, and Smoothlounge.com as well as a host of club mix shows worldwide.\nLater that year D:Fuse unveiled his new live concept \"Bring The Drums\" residency to a capacity crowd at San Francisco's renowned Ruby Skye. The new show spotlighted D:Fuse performing on his most expansive drum kit yet, featuring his signature blend of congas and bongos plus tom-toms, snares and cymbals. D:Fuse rolled out the tour to cities across the nation and later brought \"BTD\" to tours in Asia and Eastern Europe; concluding the tour as a headliner at the massive closing party of the Kazatip festival in Ukraine drawing over 10,000 people.\nIn 2007 D:Fuse began work on his release \"Thanks for Listening (The Club Singles '98-'08 Re:Mixed Re:Mastered)\". He spent over a year in the studio completely reworking, remixing, and remastering his classic tracks into a 12-song package including \"She Rides\", \"Everything With You\", \"Living the Dream\" and a brand new collaboration with The Scumfrog titled \"Stereo & Video\". Tracks from the album were immediately hammered by Armin Van Buren, Paul Van Dyk, Paul Oakenfold, Kosheen, Matt Darey, Solarstone, and Andy Moor and the album received solid reviews in M8, IDJ, and DJ Mag Ukraine as well as a plethora of websites internationally.\nD:Fuse can currently be heard on \"The People's Mix\" in podcast form. D:Fuse recently celebrated his 250th \"People's Mix\" broadcast. D:Fuse also works to further good causes. In 2004 he co-created the \"Beats Against Bush\" tour alongside Richard Vission and worked nationally with the Drug Policy Alliance against the Rave Act in 2003. Today he is organizing \"Earth:66\" (www.earth66ride.com), a charity bike ride dedicated to raising money and awareness for earth-related issues and for the organization Global Green.\nIn 2009 D:Fuse wrapping up studio sessions with Mike Hiratzka to complete their newest mix album series titled \"Clubbing in Lost Angeles\" which features 11 tracks from the Lost Angeles recordings catalogue. It seamlessly intertwines club hits like \"Massif\", \"Perfection\", and \"Everything With You\" with all new productions including \"Tobias\" and D & H remixes of Govinda's \"Can't Forget The Day\" and Nosmo & Kris B\u00eds \"One For The Road\".\nNow, Dustin Fuselier practices real estate passing the California Real Estate exam.

He never returned to school.\nHis reputation reached J Prince, founder of Rap-A-Lot Records.

He is the youngest of four older siblings, all sisters, who named him after Keith Partridge of the TV series The Partridge Family. As a kid, he <<<was known for his break-dancing skills>>> and <<<started writing songs when he was only nine years old>>>. His <<<musical influences include L.L. Cool J, New Edition, and old-school R&B when he was younger>>>. His <<<first concert was>>> by Van Halen and even met his best friend Kevin Richardson <<<when he was 12>>> in 1984 at Cathedral Domain Camp, a church-owned youth camp his father ran. They both <<<played piano and wrote>>> their first <<<songs>>> together, <<<some of which were eventually used for the Backstreet Boys' first demos>>>. After graduating high school, he attended the University of Kentucky for two years, then joined the U.S. Navy and was stationed in Little Creek, VA. After serving in the U.S. Navy, he went back to college and graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration/Management.\nMcGuffey started working as the manager of a TCBY store before he got his record deal after Kevin invited him down to Orlando for a visit. When he got down there, he auditioned for Transcontinental Records and got a record deal. While perfecting his act, Keith worked and toured Europe for the Backstreet Boys in 1995 as a bodyguard and worked as a recording artist in the 1990s under his stage name Trey D.

He studied Turkish at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. After graduating from university, he <<<went backpacking around the world>>> in the late 1980s and <<<fell in love with cinema>>>. E said, \"I saw Who Framed Roger Rabbit in Germany, Au revoir les enfants in London, and Barry Lyndon and Pelle the Conqueror in Australia. After I came home, I had to choose a job and <<<movies were the only thing I was interested in>>>. I couldn't imagine wearing a suit and working in a bank.\" E <<<entered the>>> Korean <<<Academy of Film Arts>>> in 1990 and <<<studied filmmaking>>>.\nHe first became known for his 19-minute short film, Homo Videocus (1990) which he co-directed with Daniel H. Byun (Byun Hyuk), and which won the Prix Recherche (Research Prize) and Prix de la Jeunesse (Youth Jury Prize) at the Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival, and the Best Short Narrative award at the 1992 San Francisco International Film Festival. E went on to make other short films such as My Mother's Summer and Time in the Mirror. In 1994 his documentary project, The Story of a City, was stopped in mid-production due to problems with the production company.Finally breaking his long silence in 1998, he presented his feature film debut An Affair, about a woman who starts an affair with her sister's fiance. It won great acclaim both from audiences and critics for E's minimalist, sophisticated sense of directing. The film, which resurrected the career of actress Lee Mi-sook, was presented at the third Pusan International Film Festival, and went on to become the seventh highest-grossing Korean film of the year. An Affair won the Grand Prize at the 1999 Fukuoka Asian Film Festival, as well as the Asian Cinema Kaleidoscope Prize at the Newport Beach Film Festival, and the Critics Prize and Best Artistic, Technical, or Creative Contribution at the Verona Film Festival.E's second feature, Asako in Ruby Shoes in 2000, is one of the first instances of a Korean-Japanese co-production that utilized cast and crew members in both countries on more or less equal terms. Using a Korean crew for the scenes set in Seoul, and a Japanese crew for the shooting in Japan, the film starred Lee Jung-jae as the protagonist (he was also the lead actor of An Affair).  Although not a commercial hit, the film played at several festivals, drawing notice among academics for its portrayal of the interplay between Japanese, Chinese and Korean cultures and receiving widely divergent critical assessments.Then in the fall of 2003, E presented his costume drama Untold Scandal, based on the French novel Les Liaisons dangereuses but set in 18th-century Korea. An unexpected smash hit, it set a new record for the biggest opening weekend for a Korean film and went on to sell over three million tickets. The film also marked the first major film role of TV actor Bae Yong-joon, who would go on to become a popular sensation in Japan in 2004. Staying true to the spirit of the original novel while giving it an entirely new aesthetic, E kept a familiar story interesting with unexpected juxtapositions (for example, a mix of classical European and Korean music in the soundtrack), visual elegance, and efficient storytelling. The film won several awards at the 2004 Verona Film Festival and Shanghai International Film Festival, including Best Director for E.E cast Jo Hyun-jae and Lee So-yeon (who played supporting roles in Untold Scandal) in his short titled Joy of Love, which was released online in late 2004.Given his demonstrated flair for scandalous topics and his new-generation attitude towards moral issues, for his next film E adapted the controversial webcomic Dasepo Girls, which revolved around a high school where the students are sex addicts, the teachers are perverts, and virtually nothing was forbidden. His 2006 film Dasepo Naughty Girls was a campy and playful musical comedy, with a candy-colored palette and mildly racy content. Though praised for the diversity of its characters and their preferences, it grossed US$3.8 million, which for Korean films of average budget is considered a disappointing performance.E's next project Homecoming was selected by the Hong Kong Asia Film Financing Forum (HAF) in 2007. He described it as a \"long look through the past\" in order to understand his own father more deeply, including the Korean War (\"a world colonized and liberated, a war, a country divided, the loss of his hometown, and a family separated\"), and the death of E's mother.In 2009, E gathered an ensemble cast of six of Korea's top female thespians (Youn Yuh-jung, Lee Mi-sook, Go Hyun-jung, Choi Ji-woo, Kim Min-hee, Kim Ok-bin) for his low-budget, semi-improvisational mockumentary Actresses. Set during a fashion magazine shoot on Christmas Eve, the film depicted the celebrity and humanity of actresses, with the cast all using their real-life names and telling candid stories. It became the third of E's creations to be invited to the Berlin International Film Festival's Panorama section.E, along with fellow directors Kang Hyeong-cheol and Jang Hoon were commissioned by the producers of the Samsung Galaxy Note in 2012 to make three short films for their PPL-frequent-film project Cine Note. The team also included Lee Seung-chul for the music, and noted webtoon artists Sohn Je-ho and Lee Gwang-soo who created the film's animated content.But while shooting his Cine Note short How to Fall in Love in 10 Minutes, E simultaneously decided to expand the idea into an experimental feature about remote directing, i.e. making a movie via mobile devices and the Internet without being on set. The result was Behind the Camera, in which E took the mockumentary genre a surreal step further than Actresses by including himself in the cast. As E makes an unprecedented attempt to direct the film from Los Angeles via Skype, chaotic and unpredictable circumstances arise behind the scenes as the cast and crew become frustrated without a director to guide them on set, blurring the line between fiction and reality. E said it was \"difficult to decide how to classify the film in terms of genre. The feature film seems to be a documentary about the production process of a short film, but it also has dramatic elements similar to a reality show.\"In 2014, E directed and co-wrote My Brilliant Life, a film adaptation of Kim Aeran's novel My Palpitating Life. He cast Kang Dong-won and Song Hye-kyo as young parents of a boy with progeria, a genetic disorder that causes rapid aging. Members of E's crew were trained by Oscar-winning special make-up effects artist Greg Cannom.E next wrote the screenplay of The Bacchus Lady, a film about a female senior citizens who sell sex and soft drinks to male senior citizens; it entered pre-production in 2015.\n"

His <<<mother>>> Joy Pocock <<<was a dancer and drummer in the family band>>>, in which John <<<started playing trumpet aged seven>>>.\nIn the mid 1970s the family moved to Hayling Island where a lifelong love for the sea, sailing and navigation took hold. It was here where he <<<was introduced to free jazz>>>, leading him to meet Mark Lockheart. In the 1980s John Eacott got a \u2018Psion Organiser\u2019 and started to experiment with computer programming.\nOn graduating from Sussex University, England, in 1982 BA Music, Eacott's career as a musician started with anarchic jazzers Loose Tubes (trumpet, composer), post-industrial metal bashers Test Dept (trumpet, arranger, composer), Roman Holliday, acid jazz group Vibraphonic, and as a trumpeter with a diverse array of artists including Damon Albarn, Goldie, Stereo MCs, The The, Georgie Fame, Terry Edwards and the Scapegoats. He performed with Loose Tube (30 Years Anniversary concerts),and regularly plays with Sarah-Jane Morris, the hKippers, his own Cranky Trio and other bands.\nSince the 1990s he has composed works for theatre including the worldwide touring production of Gormenghast,'. In 2012 he composed music for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) production of The Taming of the Shrew , in 2014 Turgenev's Fortune\u2019s Fool at the Old Vic, London and most recently Charles Dickens' Great Expectations  in 2016, at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds; all plays directed by  Lucy Bailey.\nFilm scores include the Miramax feature Three Steps to Heaven (1995), Escape to Life with Vanessa Redgrave (2000) and worked as arranger with Dave Stewart and Mick Jagger on the soundtrack of Alfie starring Jude Law (2004).\nIn the autumn of 1998 John Eacott performed his first live generative composition in London, UK. He developed his generative composition in two Sound Art exhibitions at Morley Gallery, London, \u2018Strange Attraction\u2019 in 1999 and \u2018Another Strange Attraction\u2019 in 2000 which featured amongst others the interactive sound designer Dominic Robson and sound sculptor Max Eastley.\nIn 2001 Eacott made a generative music album \u2018Morpheus\u2019 together with Nick Collins, Frederik Oloffson and others using SuperCollider audio programming environment. These compositions formed  part of a number of projects that contributed to his PhD \u2018Contents May Vary: the behaviour and play of generative music artefacts\u2019 (2007) awarded by the University of Westminster.Since the completion of his PhD, Eacott has focused on making accessible live performances using algorithmic composition as part of the organisation Informal.  Floodtide, which premiered at Trinity Buoy Wharf, Docklands in June 2008, is a musical performance generated by tidal flow.  Floodtide works by submerging a sensor into tidal water, the data from which is transformed by custom computer software, into notation read live from computer screens by musicians. Floodtide has been performed numerous times, most notably at Southbank Centre's See Further-Festival of Science and Arts in 2010 and the Mayor's Thames Festival in 2009. A permanent tidal sensor (provided by Nortek) is installed at Trinity Buoy Wharf which gives a constant reading of Thames tidal data on the Floodtide website. Musicians anywhere in the world can play the music generated at any time. Trinity Buoy Wharf is also the home for a Floodtide sound sculpture (2014) by Andrew Baldwin, that continuously plays live local tidal readings. In 2015 John Eacott took the Floodtide project on a five months tour on Jacomina, a 46 ft sailing yacht, performing the piece in ports in Europe and UK with local musicians.\nEacott's work Hour Angle works in a similar way to Floodtide, yet its notation is generated by calculating the movement of the sun.  Hour Angle performances include the summer solstice of 2010 at Royal Observatory Greenwich.He has taught at London College of Communication's and Middlesex University; he worked as Principal Lecturer in Music at University of Westminster  between 1993\u20132011.\n"

            "early_life": "Eaden was born in Sheffield, and began his playing career with Barnsley as a youngster. He was initially not taken on when he left school in 1989, but was given a deal later that year, and turned professional in 1991. Manager Mel Machin was critical of the player, and listed him among the players to be released at the end of the 1992\u201393 season. However, he gave Eaden his club and Football League debut as a substitute away to Brentford on 1 May. Four days later, Machin pre-empted the board's rumoured intention of sacking him by resigning. Eaden started the last match of the season, and the decision to release him was reversed on the recommendation of coach Eric Winstanley.Under the management of Viv Anderson and Danny Wilson, Eaden became a regular in the side and contributed to their promotion to the Premiership, but after Barnsley would not meet his wage demands when his contract was due to expire in 2000, he left. A proposed move to Bolton Wanderers in late 1999 did not materialise, and Eaden joined First Division club Birmingham City in July 2000 on a free transfer under the Bosman ruling. While at Birmingham he played in the 2001 Football League Cup Final and made 29 league appearances in the 2001\u201302 season as Birmingham were promoted to the Premier League via the play-offs.Eaden also had a successful spell with Wigan Athletic, winning promotion from the Second Division and then into the Premier League.He joined Nottingham Forest in 2005. Despite being successful with most of his previous clubs, caretaker managers Frank Barlow and Ian McParland did not include him in the first matchday squad in the 2006\u201307 season after an indifferent debut season in the East Midlands, although he had been promoted with every club he had been at prior to joining Forest.\nOn 31 August 2006, Eaden joined League Two side Lincoln City on loan, initially for a month, which was later extended to the maximum 93-day total. He then returned to Forest, but was again loaned to Lincoln in January 2007, this time for the rest of the season.Released by Forest, Eaden signed for Halesowen Town of the Southern League, making just one appearance. He signed for Solihull Moors of the Conference North in September 2007, and again made a single appearance before leaving, this time for divisional rivals Kettering Town, for whom he made his debut in a 1\u20131 draw away to Nuneaton Borough on 20 October.\nEaden, initially a player-coach at Kettering, became assistant to manager Mark Cooper after the 2008\u201309 season. In November 2009, Cooper was appointed manager of Championship club Peterborough United, and Eaden accompanied him, again as assistant manager. A year later, he left the club by mutual consent.On 22 March 2011, Eaden joined the coaching staff of Rotherham United on a contract until the end of the season, working under his one-time Barnsley teammate Andy Liddell. After Liddell lost out to Andy Scott for the full-time manager's role at the club, Eaden departed at the end of his contract, but was quickly back in work agreeing a two-year contract to become assistant manager to Marcus Law at Tamworth. However, just a week later Eaden announced he had \"had a change of heart\" and would not be taking up the post, instead taking up the same role at Kettering Town.During the 2012\u201313 season, Eaden worked alongside Steve Beaglehole for Leicester City under-21s as a coach, and was named on the bench for a game against Huddersfield Town as one of three over-aged players. He left in 2016 to join Rotherham United as assistant manager to Neil Redfearn, and signed a contract until the end of the 2017\u201318 season. Five days later, Redfearn was dismissed, and Eaden took on the role of caretaker manager. Before their next match, Rotherham appointed Neil Warnock as manager; Eaden was kept on the staff as first-team coach, but had little input to the first team. After Alan Stubbs' appointment as manager at the start of June, Eaden left the club by mutual consent.In July 2016, Eaden was appointed as senior development coach at Coventry City under Tony Mowbray. He also briefly acted as first-team coach under Mark Venus's caretaker managership, before leaving in September 2017 to become Jack Lester's assistant manager at Chesterfield. Lester and his staff left the club after Chesterfield were relegated from the Football League at the end of the 2017\u201318 season.National League North club Nuneaton Borough appointed Eaden as manager on 15 June 2018. He left the club on 22 November 2018. The following month he was appointed manager of Hednesford Town of the Northern Premier League. He left the club in April 2019. In June 2019 he was appointed manager of National League North club Kettering Town, but was sacked in September.In August 2022, after spending a year coaching at Jamaican club Mount Pleasant, Eaden returned to Barnsley as senior professional development coach.\n"

When she was four years old, Eadie's parents separated and she was placed in St. Francis Indian School, an American Indian boarding school, along with six of her siblings. While in high school, she dropped out to care for a younger sister.  She later studied to receive her diploma while on bed rest during her final pregnancy, and eventually pursued a college degree.

She then studied hypnotherapy, graduating at the top of her class, and later opened her own clinic.

By the time they were relegated at the end of the following season, he was Norwich's regular left winger. Even though he was unable to inspire Norwich to a return to the Premier League, his form for the club was such that his name was being linked with a number of Premier League clubs by 1997, although he would ultimately remain at Carrow Road for some three years more.He missed the start of the 1999\u20132000 season through a knee injury, and in December 1999, as a result of Norwich's financial problems and risk or relegation, he was sold to Leicester City F.C. for almost \u00a33 million, finally giving him the chance to establish himself as a Premier League player.Eadie was to only play a total 40 matches for Leicester, this number being cut short due to repeated knee injuries, and he retired in the summer of 2003, aged 28. He was cup-tied for their victory in the 2000 Football League Cup Final.\nBetween 1994 and 1997, Eadie made seven appearances for the England U21 team, scoring two goals.In the summer of 1997, Eadie was called up to the England squad for the Tournoi de France.\nIn March 2020 Eadie was appointed joint manager of Leiston alongside Chris Wigger although Chris does most of the work.\nIn 2002, Eadie was voted an inaugural member of the Norwich City Hall of Fame, which was established to celebrate the club's centenary. In an interview for the Norwich City matchday programme on 13 August 2005, Eadie stated that he had found retirement difficult, particularly as many of his friends were still playing professional football. It was reported in July 2012 that he had fought severe depression and suffered panic attacks.\n"

            "early_life": "Manly 1971\u20131983: 237 games, 1,917 points (71 tries, 847 goals, 3 field goals)\nAustralia 1973\u20131979: 20 Tests, 16 points (2 tries, 5 goals)\nNew South Wales 1974-1980: 14 games, 35 points (3 tries, 13 goals)Eadie was graded by Manly-Warringah in 1971 and showed immediate promise in the lower grades that season. The following year with the retirement of long serving Manly fullback Bob Batty, he established himself as the team's first grade fullback and his powerful running style was already a serious danger to all Manly's opponents. Though not excessively tall at just under 180 cm (5'10\"), Eadie's solid build of around 95 kg (15 stone) gave him abundant pace and so much strength that once he was on the move, few opposing defenders were ever able to stop him when he ran into the backline. At the same time, Eadie was an accurate line kicker and extremely safe under the high ball in an era when the \"bomb\" was coming into prominence.\nAlthough he had been used as a goal kicker in some games in 1972, it was only in 1973 that Eadie became Manly's major point scorer. That year, he kicked 14 goals in a match against Penrith, and for the following three years he was the leading point scorer in the competition, reaching a high of 242 points (14 tries and 100 goals) in 1975, a club record that would not be broken until New Zealand dual international fullback Matthew Ridge scored 257 points (11 tries, 106 goals and 1 field goal) in 1995.\nEadie was selected to the Australian team for the 1973 Kangaroo tour and, after an injury to Kangaroos Captain-coach Graeme Langlands, took over as Test fullback for the final two Ashes tests against Great Britain, marking his d\u00e9but at Headingley in Leeds by kicking 5 goals in windy conditions. Though Langlands regained the test fullback spot in 1974, Eadie went on to be Australia's regular fullback from 1975 until he retired from representative rugby league following the experimental 1980 State of Origin match. Despite being a record point scorer for Manly, Eadie was never a prolific point scorer at Test or State representative level as Country Firsts and later Parramatta Centre Michael Cronin was generally the first choice kicker in representative sides.\nIn 1974, Eadie won the Rothmans Medal as Sydney rugby league's best-and-fairest player, and at the end of the controversial 1978 finals series he produced one of the finest performances ever by a fullback in the Grand Final replay, \"where he single-handedly destroyed Cronulla-Sutherland by scoring a try, setting up two others for Russell Gartner and kicking three goals and a field goal\". Two years earlier, his accurate goal kicking under pressure won Manly the 1976 Grand Final where they scored only one try to Parramatta's two. Eadie's dominance in the '76 and '78 Grand Finals was recognised thirty years later with the awarding of retrospective Clive Churchill Medals for Man of the Match in those games.\nIn 1977, Eadie was Australia's first choice fullback for the 1977 World Cup and played in Australia's 13\u201312 win over Great Britain in the World Cup final at the Sydney Cricket Ground.Following the 1978 Grand Final, Eadie was selected to his second Kangaroo Tour. The coach of the 1978 Kangaroos was Eadie's Manly coach Frank Stanton, while the captain was his former long time Sea Eagles teammate Bob Fulton, who was at the time playing for Eastern Suburbs. Eadie played fullback in all 5 test matches on the tour with Australia defeating Great Britain 2\u20131 to win The Ashes, but surprisingly lost the test series to France 2\u20130. He also played in the non-test international against Wales at the St. Helen's Rugby Ground in Swansea with Australia winning 8\u20133.\nDespite Manly declining in surprising fashion to miss the semi-finals for the first time in twelve years in 1979, Eadie's form remained excellent and he played in all 3 Ashes tests against a very lackluster touring Great Britain side. He then went on to play in the inaugural State of Origin game at fullback for New South Wales in 1980, though he would miss the mid-season tour to New Zealand with the Australian team that year.\nA major injury that forced him to miss half of the 1981 season and saw him lose his test fullback spot failed to dim his brilliance: at the end of 1982, commentators were noticing how he was \"more involved in the game than at any stage since 1973.\" On his retirement from Sydney rugby league after Manly's loss to Parramatta in the 1983 Grand Final fans were left with the feeling he may still have a lot to offer the game. With fellow Australian Chris Anderson as Coach, Eadie later made a comeback for English club Halifax, when he scored sixteen tries (a record for a fullback) and helped Halifax to the 1986 Club Championship. Eadie played fullback, scored a try, and was man of the match winning the Lance Todd Trophy in Halifax's 19\u201318 victory over St. Helens in the 1987 Challenge Cup Final during the 1986\u201387 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 2 May 1987, in front of 94,273 people.\nIn 1983 he overtook Eric Simms' record for the most points scored in an NSWRFL career (1,841); Eadie's total of 1,917 stood as the new career record until it was bettered by Mick Cronin in 1985.\nAfter retirement Eadie occasionally wrote articles for such magazines as Rugby League Week and attempted to carve a career as a coach. His first attempt with Halifax was short-lived, and in 1991 he returned to Australia as coach of the Gold Coast reserve grade side.\nEadie coached The Mullumbimby Giants in the Northern Rivers Regional Rugby League competition for the 2012 season.\nHis son, Brook Eadie, won a President's Cup premiership with the South Queensland Crushers in 1996, but plans for a top grade career were thwarted by the demise of that club due to the Super League war. Eadie still lives on the Gold Coast today, where he works as a sales representative for a local brewery.\n"

He kept clean sheets in his first five matches at the club and was instrumental in the club winning promotion the following year.

Eagar particularly liked the photography in Sports Illustrated.\nDuring the 1963 West Indies series in England, Eagar took a photograph of Wes Hall breaking Colin Cowdrey's arm in the Lord's Test match. This was in spite of the fact that the ground did not permit photography. The first Test match where Eagar was an official photographer was the 1965 match at Headingley between England and New Zealand; John Edrich scored a triple century in the match.After a rise in freelance photographers, Eagar began to cover matches on a more frequent basis, beginning with the 1972 Ashes series in England.

His best-known photos include Rod Marsh's catch to dismiss Tony Greig in a 1975 Cricket World Cup match at Headingley, England captain Michael Vaughan holding The Ashes urn after England won the 2005 Ashes, and Andrew Strauss' catch in the same series. In interview, Eagar said that his favourite photo was of Gordon Greenidge playing cricket on the beach in Bridgetown, Barbados in 1973, and that his favourite player to photograph was Kim Hughes, due to his improvisation at the crease.In 2005, Eagar held an exhibit of his Test match cricket photography at Lord's. The 300th Test match where Eagar took photos was at Lord's in 2007, and the 2010 Ashes match in Perth was his 100th England-Australia Test match.In early 2011, Eagar announced that he was retiring.

            "early_life": "Eagler <<<graduated with a B.A.>>> in 1976 from Fairleigh Dickinson University <<<in Political Science and Russian Area Studies>>>. In 1977 he began working as the Safety Inspector for the New Jersey Highway Authority, serving in that capacity for ten years until he was selected to head the directorship of the Heritage Festivals at the Garden State Arts Center. When the Arts Center was privatized, Mr. Eagler was assigned to the computer area of the Highway Authority where he now works.\nIn 1990, Eagler campaigned for and won a seat on Clifton's City Council. He was subsequently reelected in 1994 and 1998. While serving on the council Eagler became a rising star in the county Democratic Party, and in 1995 was nominated with Harry Lashley to run against incumbent Republican Freeholders Walter Porter and Jack O'Brien. Although Eagler failed to finish in the top two, the Democrats stood him for election the following year with Georgia Scott and the two gained the first two seats in what would eventually become an absolute Democratic majority on the Freeholder Board in 2000. Following the Democrats taking the majority on the Freeholder Board following the 1997 election, Eagler was elected to a one-year term as Freeholder Director. He again was elected to the Director position in 2001.\nIn 2001, Eagler decided to run for state assembly as a Democrat alongside Willis Edwards III. Thanks to redistricting from the 2000 census Clifton, which had for years been linked with several Republican-leaning towns and cities, was paired with many Democratic strongholds in Essex County. Due in large part to that Eagler, Edwards, and State Senator Nia Gill swept the incumbent Republicans out of office. This enabled Eagler, with his seat on the Clifton council and the Passaic County Freeholder Board, to hold three offices simultaneously. He did not, however, stand for reelection to the Clifton city council in May of that year, but was reelected in November to a third term as Freeholder.\nEagler stood for re-election with East Orange's Sheila Oliver replacing Edwards on the ticket in 2003. Despite a divided ticket, where Eagler and Oliver ran under a separate Senate candidate, Eagler and Oliver were reelected along with Gill for a second term. He did not run for re-election in 2005 for reasons made unclear (it was not certain whether Eagler decided not to run on his own or if he had been bumped from the ticket in favor of current Assemblyman Thomas Giblin), and combined with his decision not to run for a fourth term as Freeholder Eagler left public office altogether.\nAfter taking some time off, Eagler decided to attempt to regain a seat on the Clifton City Council. In May 2006, he was returned to the council along with three other candidates that ousted four incumbents (including three that had served multiple terms). He has since stood for re-election in 2010 and 2014, retaining his seat both times, and is running for another term in November 2018.\nIn September 2022, Eagler announced his retirement from the Council after his six different full terms there (1994-98/1998-2002; 2006-2010/2014-18/2018-22), along with his term in the General Assembly; that announcement came alongside Mayor James Anzaldi also announcing his retirement from the Council, after his nine consecutive terms as Mayor (1990-2022), with reported \"infighting\" among members of the Council over the direction of the City of Clifton early in the 2020s being their main reasons for suddenly wanting to retire from the Council.\n"

The following month he agreed to stay at the Crown Ground until January after settling in well at the club.He joined League One side Port Vale on a short-term contract after impressing manager Michael Brown during a trial game in January 2017.

He won a place on the EFL team of the week after picking up an assist and a goal in a 2\u20130 win over AFC Wimbledon at Vale Park on 1 April. He also scored the only goal of the penultimate game of the season against Walsall on 25 April to take the \"Valiants\" ultimately unsuccessful battle against relegation to the last day of the 2016\u201317 season; the strike won him the club's Goal of the Season award. He left the club at the end of the season, but returned to train at Vale Park in November 2017 after new manager Neil Aspin offered him a contract, which Eagles rejected.On 23 November 2017, Eagles signed for Scottish Premiership club Ross County until the end of the 2017\u201318 season, reuniting with former manager Owen Coyle at the Scottish Premiership club. Eagles left Ross County by mutual consent on 4 April, a month after Coyle had resigned as manager.After spending 15 months as a free agent, Eagles returned to League Two on 27 July 2019 after signing a one-year deal with Oldham Athletic, with the option of a further year. However he departed Boundary Park on 6 January 2020 after agreeing to a mutual termination of his contract.On 14 November 2021, Eagles played in a charity match as part of a team of Bolton Wanderers Legends against the current Bolton first team with the match helping to raise money for Mother of Bolton player Gethin Jones, who had been diagnosed with Motor neuron disease. The Bolton first team won 7\u20134, with Eagles scoring twice for the Legends team.\nEagles joined Alcoholics Anonymous in September 2021 after being found by police while drunk in charge of a vehicle outside the home of ex-girlfriend Jennifer Metcalfe; he was banned from driving for three months and fined \u00a31,250.

Speaking about the project, the Canadian artist said \"I'm pretty excited to build a Canadian superteam into a force in the mainstream...there's a lot of depth to these characters and a lot of potential. If there's anything different in my approach at all, it'll be an authenticity to the locales because this is where I live.\"One feature of Eaglesham's work for the first two years of his return to Marvel was that his projects were uninked, in other words colored and shot directly from his finished pencils. His work on Fantastic Four and Steve Rogers: Super-Soldier also earned him the nickname \"The Evolutionary Jack Kirby,\" referring to Eaglesham's ability to keep his art fresh and innovative while paying homage to classic comic book art.Previous work for DC Comics included the Villains United series, which was written by Gail Simone.

            "early_life": "Angelique EagleWoman was born in Topeka, Kansas. During her childhood years in Kansas, she was raised mostly in a single-parent household by her mother; her family, including a brother, faced poverty conditions. When she was 8 years old, she watched her aunt and uncle on television after they won a lawsuit against the Shawnee County Sheriff's department for brutally beating her uncle, an African-American, when he went to pay a speeding ticket.As a teenager, she moved with her father and brother to her home reservation, the Lake Traverse Reservation of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate. Her grandmother, Ramona (DeCoteau) Washington and her father, Stephen L. Jackson Sr., both attended mandatory government boarding schools in South Dakota.  When she was 15 years old, she received her woman's name in the Dakota language of Wambdi Awanwicake Was'teWinyan in a family ceremony on her reservation.As a young woman, she was mentored by Roger Jourdain, former Chairman of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, and a strong sovereignty advocate for Indigenous nations. She has one son named Maverick Jourdain Eagle. His middle name is in honor of her mentor.\nBefore being appointed Dean at Lakehead University, EagleWoman taught at the University of Idaho College of Law, established the Native American Law Emphasis Program, held a position in the law faculty at Hamline University School of Law teaching Native American Law and Contracts, and a visiting position at the University of Kansas School of Law and in the master's degree program, Indigenous Nation Studies. Her classes focus on tribal economic development, legal code development, litigation, contract law, and international Indigenous law.Several times, EagleWoman has served on the board for the National Native American Bar Association. Additionally, she holds memberships with the District of Columbia, Oklahoma, and South Dakota Bar Associations.

Her tenure, which began in May 2016, made her the first Indigenous law dean in Canada. Her appointment was welcomed by the Indigenous legal community, including the Indigenous Bar Association. In June 2018, EagleWoman stepped down from her position citing systemic racism in the university and the law school.She currently is a visiting law professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, MN where she teaches in the Indian Law Program and courses in contract law and civil dispute resolution.\nEagleWoman has her BA in Political Science from Stanford University, her JD from the University of North Dakota School of Law with distinction, her LLM from the University of Tulsa College of Law, with honours, studying American Indian and Indigenous Law.During the spring of 2008, EagleWoman received the Kansas University Center for Indigenous Nation's Crystal Eagle Award.

            "early_life": "Wayne John Eagling was born in Montreal, Quebec, to Anglophone parents, Edward and Thelma Eagling. He spent much of his childhood and youth in California, where his family had moved. As a boy, he augmented his academic studies by <<<attending classes at the>>> Patricia Ramsey <<<Studio of Dance Arts>>>. There, he <<<developed into a gifted student of classical ballet>>> and, <<<as>>> he <<<matured>>>, <<<was encouraged by his teachers to pursue a career as a professional dancer>>>. In 1965, when he was 15, he <<<was noticed by>>> Michael Somes and Gerd Larsen of <<<the Royal Ballet>>> during the company's tour of the United States and <<<was offered a place at the Royal Ballet School>>> in London. He moved to England in the late 1960s, when \"swinging London,\" the vibrant cultural phenomenon of fashion, popular music, and entertainment, was at its peak. Eagling resisted its allure, however, and <<<remained a devoted student of classical ballet and related arts>>>. A strapping young man, he was <<<invited to join The Royal Ballet>>> in 1969, <<<when>>> he <<<was only 18>>>.\nEagling proved to be a valuable addition to the company. A supple and powerful dancer, he was promoted to soloist in 1972 and to principal dancer in 1975. As the product of \"an eclectic training with a mix of lots of different methods,\"  he was exceptionally versatile. He performed the leading roles of princes, gallants, and swains in the nineteenth-century classics\u2014partnering with dancers including Margot Fonteyn, Jennifer Penney, and Merle Park\u2014but he was best known for his work in the twentieth-century repertory. A favorite of renowned British choreographer Kenneth MacMillan, he created roles in a number of his works, including Elite Syncopations, a suite of ragtime dances, and Gloria, an elegiac work about the futility of war. He danced the role of Crown Prince Rudolf in the New York premiere of MacMillan's Mayerling in April 1983. He also danced in ballets by Frederick Ashton, George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Rudolf Nureyev, among others. He was especially admired as Balanchine's Apollo, as Woyzeck in MacMillan's Different Drummer, and as the Chosen One in Glen Tetley's The Rite of Spring, the first male dancer to undertake that dramatic role. While still active as a principal dancer, Eagling began to take part in choreographic workshops sponsored by the Royal Ballet. His first work for the company was Frankenstein, the Modern Prometheus, made in 1984. Other works soon followed, mounted for his home company and for companies abroad.\nIn 1991, Eagling retired from dancing and took up the post of artistic director of Het Nationale Ballet (Dutch National Ballet) in Amsterdam. As chief choreographer, he created a spate of new works in the following years. In 1996, he collaborated with Toer van Schayk on a new production of The Nutcracker and the Mouse King. Set in Amsterdam around 1810, with skaters on a frozen canal and Saint Nicholas instead of Herr Drosselmeyer, it was an immediate hit with the Dutch public and was later staged by the Finnish National Ballet and the Polish National Ballet. During Eagling's tenure as artistic director, he not only maintained the classical and neoclassical repertory of the Dutch National Ballet but actively commissioned new works by contemporary choreographers such as Ashley Page and David Dawson. After he left his post in Holland in 2003, he worked on the international scene for two years, occasionally staging works for the legendary Italian ballerina Carla Fracci.\nIn December 2005, Eagling was appointed artistic director of the English National Ballet in London, where he continued to invent new stage works. Notable among them were the witty Men Y Men, set for nine male dancers in 2009, and, in 2010, yet another version of The Nutcracker, a perennial favorite. During his seven years with this company, he was warmly appreciated by audiences and was both respected and beloved by his dancers. In 2012, however, he was forced to resign in a controversial dispute with the governing board over drastic cuts to the company budget.\n"

She studied at the University of Georgia. In 1992 she married novelist and actor David Steen on July 4.\nEakes received bit roles on nighttime television series, such as Cheers, before becoming successful in the soap opera genre. In the mid-1980s, she was the lead singer of the dance-pop rock group Big Trouble. The group released one self-titled CD in 1987, which was produced by Giorgio Moroder. Their single \"Crazy World\" charted on the U.S. singles chart, reaching No. 71. As a result, Big Trouble became short-lived one-hit wonders.She first achieved fame in the role of Macy Alexander on the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful, which she played from 1989 to 2000 (on contract), 2001 (guest appearance) and 2002 to 2003 (on contract). A very popular \"good girl\" kind of character, Macy battled with her inner demons (including an addiction to alcohol) before finally finding happiness with Deacon Sharpe (played by Sean Kanan). On the show, Macy was an accomplished singer in her own right (in tune with Eakes' hobby).\nBetween stints as Macy, Eakes hosted shows on the country music television channel Great American Country. She was also featured on country music singer Collin Raye's 2000 single \"Tired of Loving This Way\", which peaked at No. 50 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts.On July 7, 2000, her character \"died\" in a fiery explosion when her car crashed into a gasoline truck when the writers of the show felt the character of Macy no longer contributed to the show's storyline. She was brought back to the show during the B&B location shoot at Portofino, Italy in December 2002, and was then killed off after a chandelier fell on her during a concert in 2003. The decision was made to kill Macy off a second time after Eakes had decided to take the role of Krystal Carey on All My Children, as the complete opposite of Macy, playing the sexy and sassy character. The role of Krystal is loosely based on Eakes' Southern upbringing.\nEakes also starred in productions of Cinderella and Love Letters opposite her former costar Jeff Trachta in Los Angeles. The two have still been friends offscreen. The CD they recorded together, Bold and Beautiful Duets, went double-platinum in Europe.With All My Children airing its final episode on ABC in September 2011, earlier in June it was highly rumored that Eakes would be returning to The Bold and the Beautiful. She also starred as Katherine \"Kitty\" on The Grove: The Series created by Crystal Chappell and in 12 episodes of Tainted Dreams. Both were released exclusively online.\n"

Both parents split up shortly after his birth. Ploof later married Jim Eakins, a Canadian long-distance truck driver, and Dallas subsequently adopted his stepfather's last name. In October 1974, Eakins' family relocated to Peterborough, Ontario. As a youth, he <<<played in the>>> 1980 Quebec International Pee-Wee <<<Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team>>> from Peterborough.\nEakins played 4 seasons in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) for the Peterborough Petes, being named the captain in his final year and also the team's best defenseman that season. Jeff Twohey who was with the Petes for 3 decades called him the best captain the team ever had, saying \"He was a great leader. He was a hard worker, loyal, tough, and never afraid to confront people. He knew how to keep players in line.\"Eakins was drafted 208th overall by the Washington Capitals in the 1985 NHL Entry Draft.

The head shaving took place at center ice, prior to a game in December 1994, against the Long Beach Ice Dogs.\nWhile serving as the captain of the Manitoba Moose in the 2003\u201304, Eakins switched from his number 6 to number 37, in honor of his friend and former Wolves teammate, Dan Snyder, who was killed in a car accident in Atlanta, Georgia.

This view is at odds with the currently accepted view that English is a direct descendant of Anglo-Saxon which was merely influenced by the Norse language of the Vikings.

Signed to RCA Records in 1970 with bandmates Jerry Doucette, Jack Pedler, and David Kastle, the group scored a major hit with the single \"Kagie\", hitting #2 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary chart RPM in 1971.\nWhen Doucette left the group later in 1971, Georgie switched from Hammond CV Organ to guitar. The band then changed labels from RCA to Reprise Records, and then Warner Bros where they again hit the charts with the single \"Red Red The Rocking Horse\", \"Shorty McKenna\", \"Lovin Games\", and \"Love is Life\". It was during this period that Georgie was thrust into the spotlight, appearing on Canadian TV shows such as \"Canadian Bandstand\", \"Musical Friends\", and \"Like Young\", a national musical TV show out of Montreal.\nSoon following the break up of Buxton Kastle, Georgie began his relationship with Skip Prokop, founding member of the Juno award-winning rock orchestra Lighthouse. As well as contributing material to the Lighthouse project, he and Skip co-wrote the #1 Hit \"It Just Occurred To Me\" for A&M Records artist Peter Pringle. The song remained at #1 for the weeks of 2 and 9 May 1981, and earned the boys a BMI award for one of the top ten most played records of the year, and garnered a Gold Record for Pringle. This in turn led to Georgie being approached by Atlantic Records Chairman of the Board, in order to collaborate with Juno Award winner, Kim Mitchell, to write material for his first LP, Akimbo Alogo. The record went platinum and the co-writing efforts produced the Top 40 hit, \"Feel It Burn\", the \"Go For Soda\" B-side entitled \"Caroline\" with Pye Dubois, and the #1 song, \"All We Are.\" Georgie wrote the uncredited lyric hook, \"...you make me feel such a long way away...\"\nBesides being a musician, Georgie is also a record producer and co-founder of the record company \"Race Records\" (), as well as the recording studio \"A cellar full of noise\"\n"

            "early_life": "Silvina Fabars Gilall was born on 22 February 1944 in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba. Her ancestry includes grandparents from Guinea and Ghana, who helped raise her. As a child, she was taught to read and write by an aunt and was only able to attend elementary school for 2 or three years, as her labor was needed. She worked in the cane fields, planted sweet potatoes, picked coffee and hauled wood and water. She lived in a community of Haitians and learned their folk dances and patois. At the age of fourteen, she joined Fidel Castro's rebel army in the Sierra Maestra and participated in the Cuban Revolution.  In 1959, she began working at the airport in San Antonio de los Banos as a member of the legendary Mariana Grajales Women's Squad. Around the same time, she co-founded the first Cuban folk dancing company, known as the Ballet Folkl\u00f3rico de Oriente (Eastern Folk Dancing Company), where she performed as a singer and dancer until 1965.In 1966, Fabars was invited by the playwright and theater director, Eugenio Hern\u00e1ndez Espinosa, to come to Havana and try out for the National Folkloric Ensemble (Spanish: Conjunto Folcl\u00f3rico Nacional) (CFN). She was hired as a singer, but after a serious accident which damaged her vocal chords, was offered a position as a hairdresser or makeup artist. Fabars was determined to continue performing as a dancer. Unfamiliar with the folk dances and traditions of the western part of Cuba, she studied with the anthropologist Fernando Ortiz Fern\u00e1ndez, as well as many of the company's premier dancers, such as Santiago Alfonso, Luisa Barroso, Nieves Fresneda, Zenaida Hernandez and Emilio O\u2019Farrill. By 1978, she was offered a professorship to teach dance and the following year, she became the principal dancer of the CFN. Some of her most noted performances include Yoruba Iyess\u00e1 by the Mexican choreographer Rodolfo Reyes Cort\u00e9s, which became a signature piece for Fabars; Ciclo Congo; Arara, which features spinning movements with a basket on her head; and Rumbas y comparsas, in which she was the zebra. She has performed in most of the repertoire productions of the CFN and has performed throughout the world, including in Algeria, Angola, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, England, France, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Martinique, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Spain, and the United States.In addition to teaching at the CFN, Fabars has taught throughout the country and helped establish groups and dance companies. As a teacher for the International Laboratory of Cuban Folklore which is a biannual course offered to teach Cuban dance, she has taught at the University of Alberta, in Canada; University of Liverpool and University of London in England; at the Tokyo Cultural Center of Japan, as well as in Cuba, Russia and Venezuela. She spent two years in Venezuela helping the ministry of culture develop a folk dance company before returning to Cuba and establishing a folk dance training facility at the House of Culture in Camag\u00fcey, where she currently teaches.Throughout her career, Fabars has won many honors. As part of the CFN, she has shared in awards which include the Golden Sandal trophy from Festidanza 1974 held in Arequipa, Peru; in the Golden Barrel and Silver Necklace awarded by the 30th International Vineyard Festivities of Dijon, France (1975); the Silver Platter from the 1976 Billingham Folkloric  Festival of Billingham, England; and the Golden Temple trophy from the 1988 Almond Blossom Festival of Agrigento, Sicily, among many others.

Following her one-year clerkship, in 1977 she accepted a position as a staff attorney for the Alaska Public Defender Agency, working first in appeals, then misdemeanor trials, then felony trials, and then as head of the appellate division. In 1981, she was appointed by Alaska Governor Jay Hammond as the chief public defender for Alaska, replacing Brian Shortell when he became a judge. She served in that position until 1988, when she became a judge herself.In 1988, Governor Steve Cowper appointed Fabe to the Alaska Superior Court. She served as a judge on that trial court in Anchorage from 1988 to 1996, including serving as the deputy presiding Judge of the Third Judicial District from 1992 to 1995, and as a training judge for that district.In March 1996, Governor Tony Knowles appointed Fabe to the Alaska Supreme Court, to fill the seat vacated by the retirement of Justice Daniel A. Moore Jr. Three times, her fellow justices elected her to three-year terms as the court's chief justice (2000\u20132003, 2006\u20132009, and 2012\u20132015). She was the first woman to serve as Justice and as chief justice, and the second individual to serve three terms as chief justice, after Jay Rabinowitz who served four.Following the retirement of Justice David Souter from the Supreme Court of the United States in 2009, U.S. Senator Mark Begich recommended her as a possible successor in a letter to President Barack Obama.One of her focus areas during her terms as chief justice was outreach to tribal courts. An Indian Law and Order Commission report in 2013 of its investigation into public safety and justice system in Alaska Native villages commended Fabe's efforts to adapt traditional Native practices in sentencing, calling them \"innovative, impressive and welcome.\"Fabe retired from the bench on June 1, 2016. Since then, she continued to serve the Alaska appellate courts as needed, as a pro tempore judge, and she has conducted a private mediation practice.\nFabe is a sustaining elected member of the American Law Institute, a Life Fellow of the American Bar Foundation, a former President of the National Association of Women Judges, and a former member of the board of directors and Second Vice-President of the Conference of Chief Justices.\nShe received the Sandra Day O\u2019Connor Civic Outreach Award from the National Center for State Courts in 2017, the Distinguished Service Award from the same organization in 2012, and the Justice Vaino Spencer Leadership Award from the National Association of Women Judges in 2012. She was named as a member of the inaugural class of the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2009, and as a Woman of Achievement by the YWCA in 2002.\nFabe is married to Randall Simpson. They have a daughter and at least one grandchild.She has been an active supporter of arts, civic, and other community organizations, for example, as a trustee of the Anchorage Museum Organization and the Soroptimists.\n"

            "early_life": "Her novels are The Best of Intentions (New York: William Morrow, 1968); Three Women (New York: Belmont-Tower, 1972); A Perfect Stranger (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1973); The Woman Who Went Away (New York: Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1981); and Greek Revival (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1985). These works were published in both hard- and paperback editions in the U.S., the U.K., France, and various other countries.\nAlthough they were in general favorably reviewed, she became disillusioned, in the 1980s, by developments in the publishing world, gave up fiction writing, and turned to academia. She received a doctorate in American Studies from New York University in 1988, her area of interest being the Dutch colonial period of New York and New Jersey and the legacy of the Dutch in New York and New Jersey into the nineteenth century. Her doctoral dissertation was awarded the New York State Historical Association Annual Manuscript Award in 1989 and the Hendricks Prize of the New Netherland Institute (originally the New Netherland Project) also in 1989. That year, she was made a Charter Fellow of the New Netherland Project and the following year a Fellow of The Holland Society of New York, the second woman to be so honored. The first was Alice P. Kenney.Her dissertation was published by Rutgers University Press in 1991 as A Dutch Family in the Middle Colonies, 1660\u20131800. It was prominently reviewed in the major academic journals as a welcome addition to the growing literature on the family, especially as it applied to New York and New Jersey, and for providing a bench mark for studying the family in different epochs. Along with other family studies published at around the same time, it was considered among those works that laid the basis for a genuine study of the early colonial community experience in the eastern United States.\nHer second book-length work of history, Zion on the Hudson: Dutch New York and New Jersey in the Age of Revivals, was also published by Rutgers University Press (2000) and was awarded the New Jersey State Annual Archives Award in 2001. Zion on the Hudson, wrote C. H. Lippy in Choice, \u201calong with her earlier A Dutch Family in the Middle Colonies, establishes Fabend as the premier historian of Dutch American culture.\u201dIn 2012, the New Netherland Institute commissioned a book from her that was published as \"New Netherland in a Nutshell: A Concise History of the Dutch Colony in North America.\"\nIn 2004, with a feminist intent in mind, she organized her notes on the women in the family she had researched for her dissertation (her own Haring family) and turned them into a ten-stanza lyric poem called A Catch of Grandmothers, an introductory stanza and one stanza for each of her nine Haring grandmothers going back to Grietjie Cosyns, born in New Amsterdam in 1641. This bio-historical poem, unique to American letters, was published in book form by the Historical Society of Rockland County in 2004 and is currently in its third printing.In 2008, after publishing history for twenty years, she returned to the novel form with Land So Fair, a historical novel set in the Hudson Valley in the eighteenth century. Although she considers this her best work of fiction, and although she had an excellent track record in the publishing business, she was obliged to self-publish it for lack of interest by commercial publishers.Fabend's curiosity about the Dutch colonial period in New York and New Jersey was sparked at first by her learning that her father's family had been instrumental in the settling of Rockland and Bergen counties, beginning in the 1680s.Felicitously, her interest coincided with and was mightily reinforced by the New Netherland Project, a major translation effort undertaken beginning in 1974 by Dr. Charles T. Gehring in Albany, NY, under the aegis of the State of New York. Gehring's translations and retranslations of the Dutch colonial records and documents, which have been steadily published over the decades since the 1970s, gave rise to a renaissance in the historiography of the Dutch period of New York and New Jersey from which she has benefited not only in substance but in many warm friendships with her colleagues in Dutchness. In 2017, she received the Alice P. Kenney Award from the New Netherland Institute for her contributions to scholarship related to the Dutch colony in North America.\nShe is a participant in the New York Council for the Humanities Speakers Program as well as its Community Conversations, and she has over the years consulted for the Museum of the City of New York, the American History Workshop, the New Amsterdam History Center, the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, the Hudson River Museum, the New York State Historical Association, and other institutions concerned with American history. She was elected the first President of the Jacob Leisler Institute for the Study of Early New York History, located in Hudson, NY, in 2014.\nIn the 1970s, she was invited to deposit her papers in The Twentieth Century Archives, in what is today called The Howard Gotlieb Archival Center, in the Mugar Memorial Library, Boston University. The Firth Haring Collection contains copies of all her works, including a memoir she self-published in 2008, Only a Paper Life, her book contracts for her first five novels, her manuscripts of these novels, and the correspondence and reviews relating to them. (Of Only a Paper Life, Cambridge University English professor Richard Gooder of Clare College wrote, \u201cIt remains a little masterpiece. I know nothing else like it.\u201d); personal correspondence, July 22, 2009.\nHer genealogical notes and other material on the Haring family are in Special Collections and University Archives in the Alexander Library, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, and also in the manuscript collection of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society. She is married to E. Carl Fabend, lives in Verona, New Jersey, and has two daughters, three grandchildren, and two step-grandchildren.\n"

            "early_life": "Born in Geldrop, Faber grew up in the Strijp neighbourhood in Eindhoven, which also included PSV's home ground, the Philips Stadion. <<<At five>>>, he <<<started playing youth football at local amateur club>>> DBS. Faber's performances led to interest from PSV and EVV, with PSV scout Gerrit van Tilburg having discovered him at DBS. He chose to join PSV at 13. Faber's original position was right winger, but at PSV, he moved to the central defense position under the guidance of former defender and youth coach Huub Stevens.\nFaber played four matches for the Netherlands under-21 team. In February 1998, his good performances with PSV were rewarded with a call-up by coach Guus Hiddink for the senior team trip to the United States. The Netherlands were scheduled to play exhibition matches against the United States and Mexico. After being an unused substitute in the United States match, Faber made a 58th minute appearance in the game against Mexico on 24 February 1998. The match was played in Miami. He replaced Winston Bogarde when the Netherlands were leading 3\u20130. Eventually, the game finished 3\u20132, with Faber causing a penalty in favour of Mexico. Faber was one of the players considered by Hiddink to be selected for the 1998 FIFA World Cup but after he injured himself before the start of the tournament, he was unable to appear.\nIn the summer of 2005, Faber became coach of PSV's reserve team Jong PSV. In the 2005\u201306 season of the Beloften Eredivisie, Faber's team narrowly escaped relegation. But in September 2006, Faber left Jong PSV. He claimed that the team was neglected by PSV and not strengthened as promised. Faber's desire was to remain at the club, but the board did not offer him another position. Faber proceeded to join FC Eindhoven as their assistant manager in December 2006. In October 2007, FC Eindhoven sacked their manager Louis Coolen. Faber stepped up as caretaker manager for two months. He went back to his position as assistant when Gerald Vanenburg was appointed as the new manager in December. Seeking a new challenge, Faber announced in February 2008 he would leave FC Eindhoven at the end of the season. Before his departure, Faber had to become FC Eindhoven's caretaker manager again after Vanenburg resigned in April. He coached the team in the remaining three matches.In 2008, Faber returned to PSV to coach the under-19 squad. He signed a two-year contract. In November 2009, Faber showed interest in becoming the PSV academy director. The other youth coaches favoured Faber as well, but the PSV board decided to appoint Jelle Goes. He decided to leave the club again after the 2009\u201310 season, even though PSV offered him the position of Jong PSV coach. In February 2010, he passed his coaching exam, enabling him to be a manager in the Netherlands. Faber simultaneously agreed on a two-year contract as manager of MVV Maastricht. But in June, he retracted his decision after he was unsure about the club's financial perspectives. MVV accepted Faber's decision. Faber subsequently became the manager of FC Eindhoven after signing a two-year contract. The team performed well in the Eerste Divisie, with a fifth place at the winter break period. In December, Faber was approached by VVV-Venlo to become their manager, but he rejected the offer.In February 2011, Faber was appointed as assistant manager of Bert van Marwijk at the Netherlands national team. After Faber accepted the national team job, his performances with FC Eindhoven went downhill. With four points from the following eleven matches, FC Eindhoven missed out on a play-off spot. In the 2011\u201312 season, the FC Eindhoven performances were again above expectations. The team were third in the Eerste Divisie at the time Faber left the club. In March 2012, Faber returned to PSV as assistant manager after Fred Rutten was sacked as manager. Phillip Cocu was chosen as caretaker. Unlike Cocu, Faber's role was permanent after agreeing on a two-and-a-half-year contract. Faber was present at UEFA Euro 2012 when the Dutch team were knocked out in the group stage. After Van Marwijk resigned in the wake of the elimination, Faber also quit to fully focus on his job at PSV. Despite receiving several managing position offers in 2013, Faber signed a new two-year contract and continued to work as assistant manager after the appointment of Cocu as PSV manager. After 3 seasons as PSV assistant, in which Faber briefly was interim manager due to Phillip Cocu having an emergency surgery, Faber left to manage newly promoted NEC Nijmegen, where he remained for a season and impressing many clubs by leading the nijmegen side to a top half finish in the league, and proving wrong many pundits alike who believed based on Fabers previous record with PSV in the latter stages of the 2013\u201314 season that he wouldn't succeed at NEC. His performances caught the eye of FC Groningen, who appointed him manager in pre-season of the 2016\u201317 season. Faber remained in Groningen for 2 seasons, before being sacked due to inconsistency in results and a failure to qualify for the European play-offs. \nIn June 2018, Faber was appointed head of academy under new manager Mark van Bommel. \nIn November 2019, following the unexpected sacking of Mark van Bommel, Faber was appointed interim manager for the remainder of the 2019\u201320 season, after a decent 6 wins out of 11, the season was nul and voided due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, meaning that PSV automatically qualified for the 2020-21 Europa League 3rd qualifying round based on League position at the time, thus classifying Fabers brief second interim spell as an almost success. Faber left PSV eindhoven in July 202, following the appointment of Roger Schmidt as the new head coach, in a staff rebuild, Faber was also subsequently relieved off his duties as head of academy, despite being the mastermind behind the first team breakthrough's of current stars Donyell Malen and Mohamed Ihattaren.\nHis son, Cas Faber, plays as a midfielder for FC Eindhoven.\n"

            "early_life": "Diviya was born in Singapore. At birth, she was named Diviya Ganaisen Krishnan, after her father. However, her parents divorced when she was young, and she was raised by her mother, Vannitha. Soon after the divorce, Vannitha entered into a deed poll changing her daughter's name to Diviya G K.Vannitha's elder brother, Stacey Muruthi, is a former captain of the Singapore men's national team. His sons Peter and James Muruthi have also played for that team, as have Anish, Prasheen, and Navin, the three sons of Vannitha's other brother, Sreerangam Paramanantham. Diviya <<<first played cricket when she was about eight years old>>>. Initially, she <<<would play only with her five male cousins, and her uncle>>> Stacey. They <<<would play at the void deck of her grandparents' house>>> in Ang Mo Kio, <<<using biscuit tins as makeshift stumps, and a tennis ball>>>. <<<Playing against boys was challenging>>>, and Diviya's <<<cousins would tease her by saying that she could not play cricket because she was a girl>>>. <<<To improve her cricketing skills>>>, Diviya <<<would watch cricket matches on television>>>, and <<<practise batting and bowling on her own>>>. Her favourite cricketers were Kevin Pietersen, Steve Waugh and Muttiah Muralitharan. She <<<could not play cricket at her school>>>, St. Margaret's Secondary, <<<as it was not available>>>, but took up tennis as a co-curricular activity, and played hockey for the Singapore Cricket Club. Her <<<mother supported her throughout>>>. <<<When>>> she was <<<18 years old>>>, Diviya <<<was given her first cricket coaching>>>. After Diviya left school, she <<<studied Clinical Science>>> at Charles Sturt University in New South Wales, Australia, <<<a course that has greatly helped her in her cricket career>>>. While living in Australia as a student, she <<<played cricket for the men's team of a club>>>, and hockey and soccer for her university. <<<During her vacations>>> in Singapore, she <<<coached cricket>>>, hockey, and soccer for Asia Pacific Sports Management. She also planned to obtain a post-graduate degree in medicine and become a doctor. However, she was unable, due to financial constraints, to pursue post-graduate studies.\nAs a young player, Diviya took the field in various domestic competitions in Singapore. She played in the boys' U-16 Singapore Cricket Association (SCA) league, in Division Six of the SCA men's league for the national women's team, and in Division Five of that league for the Singapore Cricket Club (SCC).She also played men's club cricket in Australia, with Waratahs in Darwin in 2008, and with Cavaliers in Orange, New South Wales, in 2011.In August 2013, she became the first woman to play in Division Two of the SCA men's league. In her debut match at that level, for SCC Cougars against Marina 1, she took 4\u201324 in eight overs, was named player of the match, and earned praise from the captains of both teams. SCC Cougars won the match by six wickets.In early 2014, Diviya had a 33-day stint playing for one of the top three South African domestic women's cricket teams, Boland, in the Women's Provincial Programme 50-over tournament. As the team's players were not paid, she was sponsored by well-wishers including Joe Grimberg, former Judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court of Singapore and patron of the SCA, and Skiya Sports. The Boland team was so strong that she did not get many opportunities to bat or bowl, but she was praised by the team's coach and her teammates for her potential and determination.The following year, 2015, Divya played for the HV & CV Quick domestic team in the Netherlands. In both years, she also attempted to raise sponsorship to play domestic cricket in both Sri Lanka and Australia, but was unsuccessful. As of 2019, she was still playing domestic men's league cricket for the SCC.In mid-2019, Diviya played for several teams in the Sunbirds Women's League in Singapore, and in December 2019/January 2020 she took the field for Southern Jaguars in the Malaysian Super Women League.\n"

            "early_life": "G Koop is originally from Boston, Massachusetts. His father had a large collection of albums, and his mother contends that G Koop's first word was \"doobie,\" interpreted as a request for The Doobie Brothers to be played. His first job was at a record store. <<<As a young child>>>, he <<<learned to play a number of instruments, including guitar, bass, piano, and drums>>>. G Koop <<<graduated from>>> Berklee <<<College of Music>>>. While there, he <<<studied music theory and performance>>>. G Koop <<<plays some of these instruments in his own studio while making his samples>>>. Also while at Berklee, G Koop met Graham Richards and Anthony Caruso. The three have had an ongoing collaboration dubbed \"G Koop and O-Man\" since then.\nG Koop moved to California in 2002 and formed a jazz band, \"The People's Quintet,\" with drummer Donald \"Duck\" Bailey. Unable to find work for the group, G Koop instead began working with music production software, such as Pro Tools and Reason.He has been called a specialist in \"replaying samples\", in which an original sample is reinterpreted and recreated in the studio. The resulting track is a new interpretation that is no longer under the original's copyright, but it still retains the original's character. Producers can use the new work in their own songs without having to pay the fees required to sample the original track.G Koop first produced for the Bay Area hip-hop group Foreign Legion. The group's MC, Prozack Turner, introduced him to producer Jake One, who in turn employed G Koop as a piano teacher. The two worked together on Jake's 2008 album, White Van Music, with G Koop performing instruments. He also worked on Jake's 2009 collaboration with Freeway, The Stimulus Package. The two also partnered together on Drake's \"Furthest Thing\" for his 2013 Nothing was the Same album. Jake One found the original sample for \"Furthest Thing\" from a 1990s live gospel album that Gene Brown, a record collector, recommended to him. However, the rights owners to the song requested high fees. Instead, Jake One asked G Koop to make an interpolation of the sample to avoid publishing issues. G Koop played all the instruments\u2014guitar, piano, organ, drums, and bass\u2014in his studio. The album's main producer, Noah \"40\" Shebib, recorded the vocals for the track with a choir in Toronto.G Koop's first major placement as producer was Nelly's \"Self Esteem\" featuring Chuck D, which was on Nelly's 2008 gold album Brass Knuckles. He has worked with a number of artists, including Atmosphere, DOOM, Funkadelic, The Game, G Unit, Ice Cube, Pusha T, Rhymesayers, and Rihanna, among others. G Koop also wrote, produced, and played a number of songs with George Clinton on Funkadelic's 2014 First Ya Gotta Shake the Gate. The album, the first for the band in 33 years, provided 33 tracks with a number of artists, including Sly Stone, Soul Clap, and Bootsy Collins. The second single on the album, \"Ain\u2019t that Funkin\u2019 Kinda Hard on You,\" was written and produced by G Koop and George Clinton. Hip Hop producer Ill Tal, in his review, called it \"one of the best songs on the album and the name of George\u2019s new auto-biography. The song is smooth, mellow, and funky with George doing most of the vocal leads.\" Nick DeRiso, in his review of the album for Something Else Reviews, called \"Ain\u2019t that Funkin\u2019 Kinda Hard on You\" the \"perfect reintroduction of George Clinton \u2026 since it begins with a darkly ingratiating embrace rather that the expected turn-this-mother-out groove.\"  DeRiso goes on to call the track the \"standout moment from Funkadelic\u2019s sprawling new comeback effort.\" Other G Koop songs were singled out in reviews as well. Ill Tal wrote of \"You Can\u2019t Unring the Bell,\" that it is \"probably my favorite hip-hop influenced song on the album.\" Ill Tal went on to refer to G Koop (although not by name): \"Whoever made the beat did a great job sampling a break beat for the drums and what sounds like an old horn riff from George\u2019s vaults.\" G Koop's bass playing was also recognized in E.E. Bradman's review for Bass Player, who commended G Koop's bass playing on a number of tracks.With Metro Boomin, G Koop co-produced the song \"Bad and Boujee\" by Migos, featuring Lil Uzi Vert\u2014his first no. 1 hit. The song was released in October 2016, and it rose to no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 2017. The song has gone platinum in the United States. The album the song appeared on, Migos' Culture, debuted at no. 1 on the Billboard 200. The sample pack used on the song was originally sent to Metro Boomin, and was used to make not only Bad and Boujee, but also 21 Savage's \"Ocean Drive.\"G Koop worked with producer Southside of 808 Mafia on DJ Khaled's 2016 \"I Got the Keys,\" featuring Jay Z and Future. I Got the Keys has gone platinum, and rose to no. 30 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song is on the album Major Key, produced by Southside and co-produced by G Koop and Jake One as co-producers. The album was released at no. 1 on the Billboard 200, and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rap Album.Since then, he has worked with Ant, one of two members of Atmosphere, on Atmosphere's albums Fishing Blues and Southsiders, and in a collaboration with Brother Ali on the latter's album, \"All the Beauty in this Whole Life.\"G Koop's studio, \"Fuzz Deluxxe,\" is based in Oakland. He also runs the website \"Sample Replay Society,\" which works as a catalog for his work. He collects old instruments, such as the Clavinet and Fender Rhodes, and has several Fender guitars. He is a client of Pulse Recording.\n"

            "early_life": "G-Dragon was born on August 18, 1988, in Seoul, South Korea. G-Dragon <<<began his career at age six as part of the group>>> Little Roo'Ra. Following the release of the group's Christmas album, the group's contract was terminated by their record company, which shocked G-Dragon. Although he vowed to his mother that he \"wouldn't [try to become a singer] again,\" he was scouted by SM Entertainment on a ski trip with his family. He <<<was a trainee under the record label>>> SM Entertainment <<<for five years>>> (from 8\u201313 years old), specializing in dance before he left. During his third grade year, <<<a friend introduced>>> G-Dragon <<<to the American rap group>>> Wu-Tang Clan. <<<Having been influenced by their music>>>, he <<<developed interest in rapping and began taking classes>>>. After attending a summer school hosted by the South Korean hiphop group People Crew which he joined after begging his mom, he was introduced to Lee Hee sung, who was member of another South Korean hip hop group X-teen, who tried to make G-dragon into Korea's Bow Wow. Under People Crew's tutelage, he participated in the release of the Korean hip-hop album Korean hiphop Flex(\ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d \ud799\ud569\ud50c\ub809\uc2a4 2001) in 2001, becoming the youngest Korean rapper at 13 years old. Although he wrote his own lyrics, he admitted that his English was weak and the story behind the lyrics was just another typical \"I'm young, but I'm the best\" story. Additionally, he and future fellow BigBang member Choi Seung-hyun were \"neighborhood friend[s] from middle school\" and would often dance and rap together before G-Dragon moved away. Catching the interest of Sean of the hip-hop duo Jinusean from YG Entertainment, he recommended G-Dragon to Sean's record label's CEO Yang Hyun Suk. After signing a contract with the record label, G-Dragon spent the first year cleaning the studio for the other artists in the record label and fetching water bottles during dance practice.\n\nHe chose the stage name G-Dragon (\"Ji\" is pronounced like \"G\", and Yong is Korean for \"dragon\"). He featured on other artists' albums and even released several singles with Dong under the name \"GDYB.\" After YG Entertainment scrapped the plan and opted for a boy band instead, G-Dragon contacted Choi, who auditioned in. G-Dragon, Dong (who chose the stage name Taeyang), and Choi (who chose the stage name T.O.P), were paired with three other members (Jang Hyun-seung, Daesung, and Seungri).\nThe formation of the group was documented on television, but prior to their official debut, Jang was dropped. The now-quintet's debut was a moderate success, with their first album selling over 100,000 copies, and included G-Dragon's first solo recording, a cover of the American alternative rock group Maroon 5's single \"This Love\". The release of the EP Always in 2007 was a musical departure from their previous materials and saw G-Dragon's increased involvement in its production. Several songs were composed by him, including the lead-single \"Lies\", which became the group's first number one hit. Their following EPs followed its predecessor's footsteps: Hot Issue yielded \"Last Farewell\" while Stand Up spawned \"Day by Day\"; both singles, composed by him, were chart-toppers. Having produced the majority of BigBang's materials, G-Dragon became involved with the production of Taeyang's debut extended play Hot (2008), after which he subsequently recorded a \"Part Two\" to the EP's lead single \"Only Look at Me\".\nG-Dragon enrolled at Kyung Hee University in 2008 to study post-modern music. He later dropped out due to his busy schedule, and instead majored in Leisure Sports Studies at Gukje Cyber University, obtaining a Bachelor's degree in 2013. G-Dragon graduated in 2016 with a Master's degree in content and retail distribution at Sejong University. Plans for a doctoral degree were delayed to accommodate his military enlistment. In 2018, The Gazette Review estimated that G-Dragon's net worth is US$40 million. According to Cosmopolitan Philippines, the rapper is one of the most-followed K-pop idols on Instagram with over 21.2 million followers as of July 2022.G-Dragon began mandatory military service on February 27, 2018. After his basic training at South Korea\u2019s 3rd Infantry 'White Skeleton' Division in Cheorwon, Gangwon Province, he was assigned as a regular soldier. 3,000 VIP BigBang fans awaited G-Dragon's return from his military service at the headquarters of South Korean Army's Ground Operations Command in Yongin, southeast of Seoul. G-Dragon was discharged on October 26, 2019.\n"

He <<<wrote his first song by the time he was in the ninth grade>>> and <<<began playing harmonica in a wire rack>>>. Dutton <<<credits>>> Bob Dylan and John Hammond Jr., as well as <<<the then-contemporary \"old school\" hip-hop sounds>>> of Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys, and Philadelphia's own Schoolly D, <<<as influences>>>.\nDutton, who attended high school at the private Germantown Friends School, <<<began playing solo on the streets of Philadelphia>>>. After one year at Skidmore College, Dutton dropped out and relocated to Boston, working as a fundraiser for Peace Action and <<<playing wherever and whenever he could>>>.\nShortly after moving to Boston, Garrett <<<met local producer>>> Tom DeMille (later nicknamed T-Time by Garrett because of Tom's dual love for music and golf). Tom had hung a flyer at local music store 'Daddy's Junky Music' speaking of his desire to combine blues influences (like Muddy Waters, Howling Wolf, Little Walter, etc.) with modern music to create a new sound, which of course is exactly what Garrett was doing. Initially Garrett was focussed on recording early versions of songs like Yea It's That Easy and This Ain't living which combined street influences with classic blues instrumentation. Early renditions were typically Dobro guitar over a classic early 1990s HipHop beat and backed by synth bass and keys played by T-Time. In 1992, Garrett and T-Time both realized that neither of them was particularly good at programming good drum tracks and Garrett began looking for help in that area.\nOne of his few indoor gigs at this time was a Boston bar called The Tam O'Shanter (a Boston institution which was in business until 2018), where he met drummer Jeffrey \"The Houseman\" Clemens in January 1993. Dutton and Clemens began working as a duo, they were joined a few months later by bassist Jim \"Jimi Jazz\" Prescott and became the house band on Mondays at The Plough and Stars in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nIn 1993, T-Time flew to New York to meet with an LA producer with connections to Michael Jackson (arranged through a family friend). T-Time shared some studio and live recordings of Garrett, who had just started going by the moniker G. Love. Later in 93 G. Love and Special Sauce (as the trio was now called) signed a record deal and released their first album in 1994.\nG. Love featured Jack Johnson on his 1999 album Philadelphonic playing an early version of Jack Johnson's \"Rodeo Clowns\" when Jack was an unknown artist. Jack later featured the song on his 2003 album On and On. G. Love met Johnson through a mutual surf buddy who said, \"Hey man, there's this kid you got to meet. He's a big fan and he's got this song called rodeo clowns and I think it's really great and I really think you should hear it.\" After that G Love saw Johnson's effortless style and potential and invited him into the studio to record the now-famous \"Rodeo Clowns\".\n\nGarrett dated Tristan Prettyman and wrote the song \"Beautiful\" with her while they were dating.Known for his live shows, he is often seen touring with Jack Johnson and Citizen Cope. As a producer, Johnson signed G. Love to his record label Brushfire Records. He has made appearances on the records of artists such as Slightly Stoopid and Donavon Frankenreiter, and has toured with Dave Matthews. \nIn 2009, he collaborated with Zap Mama on their album ReCreation, singing on the single \"Drifting\".\nIn 2010, G. Love joined forces with The Avett Brothers who produced and are featured on his album \"Fixin' to Die\". The album was released under the Brushfire label on February 22, 2011.\n"

The first season he played very few games, but in the next couple of seasons he made 48 appearances, in which he scored 5 goals. He signed with Utrecht in 2004. He would, however, only play 8 matches and therefore signed a one-season loan deal with Volendam, where he made 38 appearances during the season and scored 11 goals. His role as a reserve continued at Utrecht, and as a result he was sent on loan to HFC Haarlem. There, he played 28 matches and scored only 3 goals.

            "early_life": "Gaarlandt was born in Rotterdam on October 9, 1946, to the son of Hans Gaarlandt and Anna Wilhelmina Gaarlandt Hupkes. He is a grandson of Egbertus Gerrit Gaarlandt, a mayor of Gouda, and Hermina Johanna Maria de Kat. In 1977, he married Fran\u00e7oise Kist, with whom he has a son and a daughter.\nGaarlandt studied theology at the University of Leiden, following which he <<<took up studies in art criticism>>>, completing a thesis on the art theory of the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. An article on Van Geel, published in the journal Raam attracted attention, and he was invited by the de Volkskrant newspaper to write reviews for them.\nIn 1995, Gaarlandt became the Lord of the Manor of Barendrecht, a purely honorary position without any role of governance. The hereditary title belonged to his uncle, after whose death, he purchased it for 10,000 guilders.\nPreviously, Gaarlandt has also been Mayor of Emmen and a Queen's Commissioner in Drente.\nGaarlandt's early career was as a reviewer of theological works for the de Volkskrant and the Vrij Nederland magazine between 1973-1979, following which he was assigned more and more literary criticism. Over time, he began to lose interest in reviewing Dutch literature. He said, \"My frustration with the quality of the Dutch literature increased more and more. My pieces were increasingly acidic and cynical.\" He responded to an advertisement for an editorship at De Haan and started work there in 1977.  One of his early successes was his discovery of the war diaries of Etty Hillesum in 1981. The diaries described Hillesum's experiences at the Westerbork transit camp. He edited several volumes of the diaries. Subsequently, he was an editor for the ten volume Modern Encyclopedia of World Literature. He also began to translate books from German.\nIn 1986, Gaarlandt founded the non-fiction imprint Balans, which later merged with De Bezige Bij. Balans became established following the successful publication of Hillesum's books; another popular work was the newly translated Bible by Nico ter Linden. The publishing house was also instrumental in establishing biography as a popular genre in the Netherlands, with the issue of a series of books on Queen Wilhelmina, Hendrikus Colijn, Henriette Roland Holst, and Herman Gorter.Gaarlandt's first book The Ironic Charter, published in 1975, was a collection of poetry. His first novel, The Figure in the Distance, was published in 1998 under the pseudonym Otto de Kat. The pseudonym derived from a distant relative of Gaarlandt's, the painter Otto B. de Kat. His second novel, Man on the Move came out in 2002, while his third, Julia was published in 2008. His 2012 novel News from Berlin was made into a film by Ben Verbong based on a screenplay by Toenke Berkelbach.\nTranslations of Gaarlandt's books have appeared in German, French, Italian and English.\n"

His channel gained 1.3 million subscribers before being shut down in July of that year. His success led Takashi Tachibana, the leader of the fringe NHK Party that focuses on reforms to the Japanese public broadcaster, to recruit him for the 2022 Japanese House of Councillors election. GaaSyy's platform included a pledge to work from overseas, and won the election with over 287,000 votes.As of July 2022, he lives in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. In August 2022 he skipped what would have been his first day as a lawmaker because he feared arrest, on grounds of alleged fraud and defamation against celebrities, if he came to Japan. GaaSyy skipped all future House of Councillors sessions, instead continuing to post on his social media channels.In January 2023, locations linked to GaaSyy and his advertising revenue management company were raided by police to investigate alleged defamation and intimidation of celebrities as well as obstruction of business. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department also requested GaaSyy to appear for an interview.In February 2023, GaaSyy was asked by the House of Councillors to fly to Tokyo and deliver an in-person apology for his continued absence during an open session, the penultimate disciplinary step before expulsion. GaaSyy initially promised to do so, but backtracked, citing fear of prosecution despite sitting parliamentarians in Japan having immunity from prosecution. His reversal lead to party leader Tachibana resigning in favour of actress Ayaka Otsu. GaaSyy instead posted a video about going to Gaziantep, Turkey to help in the recovery efforts after the February 2023 earthquake.The disciplinary committee of the House of Councillors voted to expel him on March 14, which was made official by the whole body the following day. The final expulsion vote passed 235\u20131, with the only \"no\" vote being his fellow party member, Satoshi Hamada. The expulsion was the first in over 70 years, and the first ever instance of expulsion for non-attendance. After the expulsion vote, party leader Ayaka Otsu expressed disappointment, noting that he had openly campaigned on working from abroad, so his constituents would not be upset by remote work.The expulsion meant that GaaSyy no longer had immunity from prosecution afforded to parliamentarians while parliament was in session.  On March 16, 2023, Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department requested an arrest warrant for GaaSyy over alleged defamation in his social media videos, as well as for his editor. It also requested that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs demand the return of GaaSyy's passport.On April 14, 2023, the Metropolitan Police Department announced that it had issued an international arrest warrant for him through Interpol. On June 4, 2023, the Metropolitan Police Department arrested Higashitani immediately upon his arrival at Narita Airport on suspicion of habitually threatening celebrities and others.\n\n\n== References ==\n"

            "early_life": "After attending public elementary education, he attended the Christian Gymnasium in the Hague, specialising in sciences. After graduating in 1956 he <<<studied law and economics>>> at the Free University of Amsterdam, <<<receiving his Master of Law, and Doctorandus in Economy>>> in 1963 cum laude. In the last four years of his study he taught Civil Law, Commercial Law and Political Economics. Following graduation he became a fellow at the Social Faculty of the Free University, and <<<wrote his dissertation in Economics>>>. During this period he taught macro- and micro-economic theory. In 1966 he <<<received his Ph.D. in Economics>>> for his dissertation \"Theory of competition policy\".\nIn 1967 De Gaay Fortman left Amsterdam to become a senior lector at the University of Zambia in Lusaka, where he was head of the Economic faculty. Here he taught Economics of Rural Development, and Theory of the Economic Order. In 1968 he was appointed Chairman of the Agricultural Prices and Marketing Committee, an advisory Body of the Zambian government. He wrote two books about his residence in Zambia: \"After Mulunguhsi, the economics of Zambian Humanism\" in 1967 and \"The Third World in Movement, a message from Zambia\" in 1972.\nWhile in Zambia De Gaay Fortman kept close tabs on the developments in Dutch politics. De Gaay Fortman was a member of the Christian-democratic Anti-Revolutionary Party. In 1970 he joined a group of so-called \"spijtstemmers\" (English: \"the Sorry Voters\") or Americain Group (after restaurant Americain, where the group regularly met). The group regretted that their party, ARP, joined a coalition with the liberal VVD instead of the social-democratic Partij van de Arbeid. In 1967 he edited the book \"Christian-Radical\", in which a new leftwing Christian faith was articulated. In 1970 he left the ARP to join the PPR, a Christian-radical party set up by former members of the KVP, who also regretted the Christian-democratic/liberal coalition.\nIn 1971 De Gaay Fortman returned to the Netherlands from Zambia for the election campaign of the PPR. He was one of the two top candidates of the party. In the elections the party got two seats in the House of Representatives, one of which was to be occupied by De Gaay-Fortman. During his period as member of the House of Representatives, he was Professor Extraordinary of Economic Development at the Institute of Social Studies in the Hague. After the election he became Shadow Minister for International Development in Den Uyl's Shadow cabinet. \nHe led the party in the 1972 elections, in which the PPR more than tripled its seats to seven. De Gaay Fortman became the leader of the parliamentary party. Between 1973 and 1975 he was vice-chair of the Defence Committee of the House of Representatives.\nHe seemed an atypical PPR-member, well-educated, upperclass, and with his affected speech. De Gaay however was very popular under young people. In parliament he showed a keen interest in development cooperation.\nBefore 1977 elections the younger Ria Beckers succeeded De Gaay Fortman. De Gaay Fortman became a member of the Senate. He kept this position until 1991. During this entire period he was the party's leader in the Senate. After 1981 however his party was a one man's party. In 1989 his party, the PPR merged with the PSP, CPN and the EVP to become GroenLinks. De Gaay Fortman remained senator for this party.\nDuring this period De Gaay Fortman returned to his passion, science. He was professor of Political Economy at the Institute for Social Studies between 1977 and 2002. He also held many positions in the World of Development Cooperation: most importantly he was president of NOVIB, the Dutch branch of Oxfam, between 1977 and 1984. \nIn 1990 he gave up his seat in the House of Representatives to become delegate for the Reformed Church at the Assembly of the World Council of Churches in Canberra. In 1990 he also founded Economists for Peace, with the late Jan Tinbergen.\nAfter 1991 Bas de Gaay Fortman has held numerous research positions: from 1991 to 1993 he was the director of research for the Institute for Social Studies. Here he taught Political Economy of Jurisprudence, Transition and Development. In 1992 he served as the chair of the Joint Steering Committee of the Netherlands Israeli Palestinian Research Programme (NIRP). From 1992 to 1998 he was a researcher in both the Research School for Development Studies (CERES) and the Netherlands Research School on Human Rights. From 1992 to 1993 he was the chair of the Directorate of the CERES School of Excellence in which six Dutch universities participated. Since 2000 he has been the chair of the Working Programme Formation and Disintegration of States of CERES.\nDe Gaay Fortman also served as correspondent in the Netherlands for several development programs, such as the United Nations Development Program and the European Commission's.\nIn 2002 he became professor of Political Economy of Human Rights at the University of Utrecht. He is the only chair in Political Economy of Human Rights in the world. Until 2005, he taught his trademark class \"Political Economy of Human Rights\", which was part of the Master in Conflict Studies at University of Utrecht. In this class, the majority of the readings used are his own unpublished works. In 2002 he also became a member of the permanent committee for Development Cooperation of the Advisory Council for International Questions of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Since 2003 he has been the vice-president of the Prins Claus Chair of the University of Utrecht and the ISS.

            ],
            "early_life": "Meschac Gaba was born in Cotonou, Benin, in 1961. He had drifted from his training as a painter until <<<a bag of decommissioned money cut into confetti led him to make paintings with the material>>>. Gaba became known for his installations of everyday objects that whimsically juxtapose African and Western cultural identities and commerce.He held a residency at the Amsterdam Rijksakademie in 1996 for two years. In the absence of opportunities to display his work in the city, he set out over the next five years to make his own museum. This piece became his seminal The Museum of Contemporary African Art 1997\u20132002, which consists of 12 rooms (some based on museum function and others personal) filled with objects made by Gaba. Throughout the exhibition ran a vein of confessional narrative about the artist's art travails between Africa and Europe. The wedding room, which he made while in love, holds mementos as museum artifacts from Gaba's wedding to the Dutch curator Alexandra van Dongen in 2000 at the Amsterdam Stedelijk Museum. The Library room holds art books and tells of Gaba's childhood. The games room showed sliding puzzle tables that form African national flags. It had its own gift shop and caf\u00e9. The exhibited Museum had couches for reading, a piano for playing, and featured objects reflecting Africa's polycultural character, including Ghanaian money featuring the face of Picasso, a Swiss bank mimicking an African street market, and gilded ceramic chicken legs.The Museum exhibited widely. The work was first displayed in part in 2002 at Documenta 11. Gaba received a Rotterdam space in which he could live and store the work. When his son requested a more normal house, Gaba sold and gifted most of the work to the Tate Modern, save for his Library, which Gaba returned to his hometown. Around 2013, Gaba lived half the year in his hometown of Cotonou and the other half in Rotterdam with his wife and son. The Tate Modern displayed the work as a whole in 2013 as part of the Tate's two-year program of African-focused exhibitions. The wedding room enchanted the British art critic Jonathan Jones, who described the Museum as autobiographical, novelistic, protest showing \"the strength of modern African art\". For instance, the Art and Religion room showed \"classic\" African ceremonial sculpture alongside kitschy Buddhist and Christian objects, as if to group the types together as poor representations of their respective cultures. Gaba saw the work as correcting lacks of art education in Africa and African art representation outside the continent.In-between finishing the Museum and its Tate exhibition, Gaba presented at the 2003 Venice Biennale and held his first solo show in the United States at the Studio Museum in Harlem, \"Tresses\", a series of architectural models of New York City and Benin landmarks made from artificial braided hair extensions. The accessory, popularized by African-American pop stars based on West African culture, was repatriated to Africa. Gaba worked with a Beninese hair braider to make the sculptures from his photographs. Holland Cotter wrote in The New York Times that the works were \"delightful\" and recognizable without becoming caricatures.Gaba held his first solo gallery show, \"Exchange Market\", in New York in 2014. On the ground floor, 10 sculptures of unvarnished wood tables each with a wire umbrella stand, from which African banknotes hung. Each table was associated with a type of commodity: cotton, cocoa, diamonds. Along the walls hung bank-shaped works made of wood, plexiglass, and decommissioned money. Upstairs, reminiscent of the games room of Gaba's museum, were four foosball tables and small souvenir sculptures such as hand-painted cricket bats and a miniature billiards table.Artsy selected Gaba's work as a highlight of the 2014 1:54 London art fair.\n"

            "early_life": "Donna Rae Gabaccia was born in 1949 and grew up in rural New York State. Her mother's family were immigrants to the United States from Germany and her father's family were Italian immigrants. As the first of her family to attend university, she <<<was interested in her family migrations>>> and <<<began her studies in sociology>>>. After completing a bachelor's degree at Mount Holyoke College, she <<<earned her master's degree in history>>> in 1975 from the University of Michigan. She then went on to complete her PhD at the University of Michigan in 1979 and did post-doctoral studies in Germany at the Free University of Berlin's John F. Kennedy Institute for North American Studies. While she was studying in Germany, Gabaccia took her first job, as a current events commentator for the German and American Forces Network Radio. She worked with projects with Amerika Haus Berlin and several museums.\nReturning to the United States, after having learned both Italian and German, Gabaccia taught at Mercy College from 1982 to 1991. Her first book, From Sicily to Elizabeth Street: Housing and Social Change among Italian Immigrants, 1880\u20131930 (1984) evaluated working-class, residents on a single street, focusing on class and community among the immigrants living there. Her initial output evaluated migration through the lens of gender and household composition, rather than the conventional focus on privilege, which forces the family unit into an unknown abstraction, and the narrow focus on individualism. By focusing on the family, she was able to evaluate the separate economic contributions of family members and shifting power dynamics between genders. Two of Gabaccia's groundbreaking books, which both integrated women into migration studies and demonstrated the importance of an interdisciplinary approach were Immigrant Women in the United States: A Selectively Annotated Multidisciplinary Bibliography (1989) and Seeking Common Ground: Multidisciplinary Studies of Immigrant Women in the United States (1992). These books laid the foundation for her \"pathbreaking work on gender and migration\", From the Other Side: Women, Gender, and Immigrant Life in the U.S., 1820\u20131990 (1994).In 1990, Gabaccia initiated a world-wide research network, \"Italians Everywhere\" to facilitate migration study for the period 1870 to 1970 of emigration from Italy. By bringing together specialists with global expertise on a variety of locations, the network was able to evaluate the cross-cultural contribution to nation building and identity. Three edited volumes, Italy's Many Diasporas: Elites, Exiles and Workers of the World (2000) with Fraser M. Ottanelli; Women, Gender and Transnational Lives: Italian Workers of the World (2002) with Franca Iacovetta; and Intimacy and Italian Migration: Gender and Domestic Lives in a Mobile World (2011) with Loretta Baldassar have been produced as a result of the interdisciplinary collaboration of the network. Abandoning nation-based analysis of migration, Gabaccia recognized that when people moved, it impacted both the place from which emigrants originated and the place where immigrants resettled. Gabaccia added depth to the understanding of migration, by showing that it was not a single national story; that destinations were not always finite but often immigrants moved back and forth between locations; and that assimilation was much more complex than a one-directional transfer of culture.These works refuted the notion of transnationists, who believed that global migration was a contemporary 20th century phenomena, characterized by the utilization of technology to quickly assimilate but retain ties to their traditional homelands, which created a climate of dual allegiance that would ultimately undermine national socio-political organization. Gabaccia argued that the study of earlier migrations, not only showed that globalization was not a new phenomenon but that it was unclear whether it was either a permanent shift in cultural practices, sustainable over time, or whether it would lead to the demise of the nation-state. She pointed to the development of diaspora populations of earlier times of internationalism and cosmopolitanism, questioning whether transnationalism was an ideological belief held by migrants, or whether it had any permanency based on historical precedent.From 1992 to 2003, Gabaccia was the Charles H. Stone Professor of American History at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, taking the Andrew Mellon Professor of History at the University of Pittsburgh in 2003. Gabaccia left Pennsylvania in 2005 and until 2012, she held the Rudolph J. Vecoli Chair of Immigration History at the University of Minnesota. During the same period, she was the director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota. During this period, she continued steady production on works dedicated to migration patterns. She particularly focused on the history of women migrants and statistical analysis to bring deeper understanding to the gendered experiences of the past, including changing sexual standards. Her work also evaluated hierarchies of power and it fluctuations upon the agency among migrating people. She also studied the exchange of culture that is evident in food. Her book We Are What We Eat: Ethnic Food and the Making of Americans, evaluates how the food of migrants became a part of the mainstream American diet.After stepping down from the position as director, Gabaccia remained as a professor at the University of Minnesota for two more years, moving to Toronto in 2014, where she teaches in the history department at University of Toronto Scarborough. In 2013, her book, Foreign Relations: Global Perspectives on American Immigration (2012), was translated and republished in Japanese and won the Immigration and Ethnic History Society's Theodore Saloutos Prize in 2013. Her book, Gender and International Migration: From the Slavery Era to the Global Age (2015), written with Katharine Donato, was shortlisted for the American Sociological Association's Thomas and Znaniecki Book Award, winning honorable mention in 2016. In addition to her academic work, throughout her career Gabaccia has worked as a consultant and collaborator with groups of public school teachers, local and national museums, and historical societies to develop a collaborative understanding of knowledge and interpretations of the past. Among those, organizations were the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience, the Levine Museum of the New South, the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, the National Endowment for the Humanities, National Public Radio, the United States Department of Labor and the Ward Museum of Toronto.\n"

Doughty was a doorman known for his improvized comedic quasi-raps, while the others appeared at the Knitting Factory in various bands. Doughty, Degli Antoni, and Steinberg all performed in versions of John Zorn's composition Cobra, appearing on John Zorn's Cobra: Live at the Knitting Factory (recorded 1992, released 1995).Within a year of its formation, the band was signed to Slash Records, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records. The group released three albums: Ruby Vroom (1994), Irresistible Bliss (1996) and El Oso (1998), with the latter showing a marked drum and bass influence. Irresistible Bliss and El Oso both reached the Billboard 200 albums chart. The band enjoyed minor hit singles with \"Soundtrack to Mary\" and \"Super Bon Bon\".In 1996, Soul Coughing contributed to the AIDS benefit album Offbeat: A Red Hot Soundtrip, produced by the Red Hot Organization. Also in 1996, one of the group's songs, \"Unmarked Helicopters\", was included in the Songs in the Key of X: Music from and Inspired by the X-Files.

Roni Size). Their song \"Super Bon Bon\" was included on the soundtrack for the video games Gran Turismo 2 in 1999 and The Bigs 2 in 2009.The song \"Circles\" from El Oso reached #8 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart, and was used as the soundtrack to a Cartoon Network extended commercial that poked fun at repeating cartoon backgrounds.Soul Coughing broke up in 2000. Mark Degli Antoni moved on to a career as a film score composer, while Mike Doughty began a prolific solo career, occasionally revisiting Soul Coughing songs in new styles.Lust in Phaze, a greatest hits compilation including a few B-sides, was released in 2002. Rhino Records reissued Soul Coughing's three studio albums on 180-gram black vinyl in 2015, marking the first time Ruby Vroom had been pressed to vinyl. In 2017, Swedish record label Woah Dad! acquired Soul Coughing's back catalog from Slash Records.\nSoul Coughing was honored with a star on the outside mural of Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, which recognizes performers who have played sold-out shows or otherwise made major cultural contributions to the iconic venue. Receiving a star \"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis\", according to journalist Steve Marsh. Soul Coughing was especially popular in Minneapolis, thanks to airplay on alternative radio station Rev 105, and regularly performed there to audiences five to ten times larger than in other cities.\n"

Other changes he instituted included the split-off of Israel Railways from the Ports and Railways Authority and its transformation into a government company, as well as making the Postal Authority and the Government Department of Public Works an auxiliary unit of government companies.\nAfter leaving the Government Companies Authority, Gabbai was appointed director of the Israeli branch of the investment fund Babcock & Brown. The branch had been negotiating to acquire advanced CHIC Company Canadian holdings Franchisee Route 6 throughout the country. The value of Route 6 was estimated at 300-400 million dollars, but at the end of negotiations no business deal was reached. During this time, the global economic crisis broke out and the value of Australian companies had deteriorated as well as the value of its holdings in Israel. In light of the difficult financial situation of the parent company, Gabbai recommended the closure of the Israeli branch, which closed in late 2008. During his role he studied the Israeli branch infrastructure and the tenders participation, Sorek desalination and a solar power plant construction Ashalim.

He taught us especially what 'not' to do.\"In 1983, Gabbana and Dolce left Correggiari to work on their own; two years later, they launched Dolce & Gabbana S.p.A. (D&G).In October 1985, the Dolce & Gabbana brand made its fashion show debut at Milano Collezioni's Nuovi Talenti (New Talents).

            "early_life": "Gabbidon was born in Wales to a Jamaican father and a Barbadian mother. Gabbidon had made 17 appearances for the Welsh Under-21 team, when an unexpected call up for the Welsh senior squad in the World Cup qualifier against Belarus in October 2001 prevented him from making his final appearance for the under 21 side. He was an unused substitute in that match and was again called into the senior squad for a friendly game against Argentina in February 2002 but it was not until the next month that he made his debut in a 0\u20130 home draw against the Czech Republic on 27 March 2002. He became a regular in the team despite a back problem that caused him to miss a large part of the 2002\u201303 season, and was part of the squad that narrowly missed out on a place at Euro 2004, losing to Russia in the play-offs, and the squad that did not qualify for the 2006 World Cup. Roy Evans, the Wales assistant coach, tipped Gabbidon to be a future captain of the national side, saying, \"I see him as potential captain material even if it is not my decision. But he has all the qualities. You do not always have to be vocal, you need to lead by example.\" Gabbidon captained the side in place of the injured Ryan Giggs in 1\u20130 away defeat against Cyprus in November 2005 and again in place of Craig Bellamy in a 1\u20130 win against Bulgaria in August 2007.In October 2010 Gabbidon announced his retirement from international football.\nHowever, on 6 January 2011, it was revealed that new Wales manager Gary Speed had asked Gabbidon to rethink his decision to retire from international football \"He is the type of player I would like to see change his mind, I have left a couple of messages for Danny and I'm sure he'll get back to me in due course\" said Speed. Wales & Celtic midfielder Joe Ledley who is also a close friend of Gabbidon, has also called for the West Ham man to return to the international fold. Ledley told his Twitter site: \"I think my best mate in football Danny Gabbidon should come out of retirement and play for Wales. We need him.\"\nHe was subsequently named in the squad to face the Republic of Ireland in February 2011.\n"

He went to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1997 <<<as a choral scholar>>> where he <<<sang>>> under Christopher Robinson and <<<studied law>>>; he was part of, and occasionally directed, \"The Gentlemen of St John's.\"  He also sang with \"Collegium Regale,\" the modern-day equivalent of The King's Singers at King's College, and Cibus Amoris, and <<<enjoyed a full part in university musical life>>>, <<<singing in>>> and <<<directing numerous performances of diverse choral repertoire>>>. After <<<graduating>>> in 2000 <<<with a bachelor's degree in law>>>, he attended the Oxford Institute of Legal Practice and <<<sang as a lay clerk in the choir>>> of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. In 2001, he <<<began training to be a lawyer>>> with the London firm, Stephenson Harwood, qualifying as a Solicitor of the Supreme Court in 2003.\nWhilst practising as a lawyer he maintained his singing career, performing with many groups including Polyphony, The English Concert, The King's Consort, and in the inaugural concert of European Voices in a performance of Wagner's \"Parsifal\" at the BBC Proms under Sir Simon Rattle. He also sang as a Gentleman of the Temple Church (of \"Da Vinci Code\" fame) under Stephen Layton, where he performed in Sir John Tavener's epic work \"The Veil of the Temple\" in 2003.\nHe joined the King's Singers as their 2nd Baritone in early 2004, following an extensive audition process, deciding to put his legal career on hold. During his time in the group he acted as Managing Partner and effective in-house legal counsel, presiding over a successful period of growth and renewal in the ensemble's history, and celebrating both the group's 40th and 50th Anniversaries in 2008 and 2018 respectively. Gabbitas toured across six continents, performing around 2,000 concerts in over 50 countries worldwide and recording in excess of 30 albums during his tenure in the group. During this time, Gabbitas made several broadcasts for BBC Radio 4, presenting documentaries which looked at aspects of the singing voice and choral performance. He left the ensemble, along with Countertenor Timothy Wayne-Wright, at the end of 2018.\nIn The King's Singers 50th Anniversary GOLD Book, Gabbitas credits his initial colleagues in the ensemble, including David Hurley, Philip Lawson and Stephen Connolly, as being formative influences in his continuing musical career. Hurley and Connolly, in particular, sang with two of the original members of the group and were therefore easily able to pass down the principles of sound, balance and blend that were the hallmarks of the early group's performances and recordings. Lawson's arranging style, which owed much to Bob Chilcott (another former member of The King's Singers), informed Gabbitas' own choral arrangements and position on building choral sound from the bass upwards.\nIn early 2019 Gabbitas was appointed artistic director of the Phoenix Chorale, an American Grammy Award-winning chamber ensemble based in Phoenix, Arizona, succeeding Charles Bruffy. As Artistic Director Gabbitas has started a new path for the Phoenix Chorale by doing a Master Works Program.  During the same year Gabbitas also took up a position as Artist Professor at the University of Redlands in California, USA, teaching a unique Master of Music degree in Vocal Chamber Music and Commercial Music-Making.\nHe maintains a position as consultant solicitor with Keystone Law, recognised as one of the most innovative legal service providers in the UK, advising on creative commercial matters.\nWhilst on tour in America in late 2004 he met Stephanie Seales, a musical theatre actress and successful businesswoman who set up one of the largest babyballet franchise operations in the UK.\nThey married in the summer of 2006 in America and England, and with their three daughters divide their time between a home in England and family in the US.\n\n\n== References ==\n"

He became known for his positions sometimes considered controversial on certain societal subjects, such as the professionalization of prostitution, same-sex marriage and the legalization of cannabis. Recently he rejoined the Greens, due to his disappointment with Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's government, and also because of the way the Worker's Party was dealing with its remaining members.\n\nDuring his exile in the 1970s, Gabeira lived in several countries including Chile, Sweden and Italy. In Stockholm, where he spent most of his exile, he studied anthropology at Stockholm University and worked as a journalist as well as a metro conductor  He returned to Brazil in 1979, where he began to act as a journalist and writer, defending the end of the military regime.\nAfter 1985, Fernando Gabeira started to support the causes of minority rights and the environment.\nGabeira has repeatedly voiced his ideological support for the legalization of marijuana, for equal marriage laws and for the legalization of abortion. He ran for the mayoral office of Rio de Janeiro in 2008, and was defeated by Eduardo Paes in the runoff round on October 26 (49.3% \u2013 50.7%).  He also lost a bid to become Governor of Rio de Janeiro in 2010.\nIn 1979, he wrote the book O Que \u00c9 Isso, Companheiro?, about his participation in the armed struggle against the military regime in Brazil (1964\u20131985) and his subsequent exile in Europe. The book won the Jabuti Literature Prize in the biography and (or) memories category in 1980 and was made into the film Four Days in September by filmmaker Bruno Barreto in 1997.\nIn 1980, he released The Twilight of the Male, a continuation of O Que \u00c9 Isso, Companheiro?.\nIn 1981, he launched Entradas e Bandeiras , a book in which he chronicles his return to Brazil and his abandonment of Marxist ideology, starting to fight for issues such as ecology, pleasure and sexual freedom. In the same year, he launched H\u00f4te da utopia, in which he deepens his new ideological positioning.\nIn 1982, he launched Sinais de vida on Planeta Minas, in which he tells the feminist struggles against the conservative society of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais , through the biographies of five women from Minas Gerais. Among them, Dona Beja and \u00c2ngela Diniz .\nIn Goi\u00e2nia, 57th street \u2013 the nuclear plant in the land of the sun, launched in 1987, Gabeira narrated the radiological accident that occurred in Goi\u00e2nia in September of that year.\nIn 2000, he launched the book Marijuana , in which he discusses the decriminalization of its use, its therapeutic functions, the social role it plays etc.\nIn 2006, he launched the book Navigation in the fog, under a Creative Commons license, dealing with the Leech Scandal in 2005.\nIn 2012, he released the book Onde Est\u00e1 Tudo Aquilo Agora .\nIn 2017, he released the book Tropical Democracy: An Apprentice's Notebook, in which he recounts the events of Dilma Rousseff's impeachment, as well as an overview of the last thirty years of Brazilian democracy.\nGabeira is the son of Paulo Gabeira and Isabel Nagle, both Lebanese immigrants. His surname was aportuguesado (expression meaning transformed to fit Portuguese language sounds) from the transliterations Jabara or Gebara (in Arabic : \u062c\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0629).He was married to Brazilian fashion designer, Yam\u00ea Reis, with whom he had two daughters, Tami and Maya. The couple divorced in 1999.\nHis daughter Maya has since become a top female big wave surfer. She said the trauma of her parents' divorce drove her to leave home at age 15 and go to Australia on a student program. She moved to Hawaii in 2004 at age 17 to surf world class waves. She quickly emerged as the world's top female big-wave surfer, winning global championships surfing challenging spots like Mavericks, Waimea, Todos Santos, and South Africa's shark-infested \"Dungeons\". She told Huck Magazine in 2007: \"My dad and I are very similar. All the energy he's put into improving the country I have as well \u2013 only I've been channeling it into my surfing.\" She added: \"My dad has a really strong character, is incredibly bright and I\u2019ve learned a lot from him.\"\n"

According to Ha, his parents were well-educated Korean immigrants whose aspiration was that their three sons would obtain prestigious degrees and enter corresponding careers. Gene <<<was the most introverted of his brothers>>>, <<<a \"geek\" who sought out escapist fantasy particularly through comic books>>>. <<<Whilst his siblings displayed impressive artistic talent>>>, they <<<lacked the patience to sit for hours on end applying themselves to illustration>>>. Ha <<<notes parallels between his generation of Asian-American comics artists and the generation of Jewish creators from the 1930s>>>, <<<both of whom were children of immigrants struggling to fit into America>>>. Ha <<<cites as his influences numerous creators from the 1980s>>>, such as John Byrne, Frank Miller, Bill Sienkiewicz, Walter Simonson, Alan Moore, and most importantly Matt Wagner, whose Mage series Ha says is still \"epic\" to him, and its main characters \"personal archetypes\". Ha <<<took few classes in art>>>, as he <<<was only interested in drawing as a means of creating comics>>>, and South Bend offered little in the way of education in realistic drawing. He <<<began to truly understand graphic arts when working on his high school newspaper>>>, The Clay Colonial, <<<winning the Most Valuable Staffer Award, which was unusual for an artist>>>. After high school, Ha <<<attended the College for Creative Studies>>>. <<<In his last semester he sent drawing samples to Marvel and DC>>>. Although he received a harshly critical response from Marvel, <<<DC was interested and sent him a sample script>>>.\nHa's first published comics work was in Green Lantern vol. 3 #36 (Feb. 1993), whose story, \"The Ghost of Christmas Light\", was written by Gerard Jones. He would draw a number of comics for DC and Malibu Comics, and did work for Marvel as well, illustrating the 1994 miniseries The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix, which documented the childhood of the character Cable. He would draw that miniseries' sequel as well, Askani'son.\nHa was one of the artists on the Shade limited series which spun off from the Starman series. He would subsequently illustrate a number of different properties for various publishers, including Aliens: Havoc, Superman, JLA Annual, which included interiors and cover work. In 1999, he began illustrating Top Ten, one of the series of Alan Moore's America's Best Comics imprint for Wildstorm. He would draw that series' twelve issues which ran until late 2001. Moore and Ha collaborated on the Top 10: The Forty-Niners graphic novel prequel published in 2005.In 2002 Ha wrote \"The Stronghold\", an Iron Fist story published in Marvel Knights Double Shot #4, which represented his first published comics writing.In 2006, Ha was set to serve as artist on the first four issues of a relaunch of Wildstorm's The Authority, with writer Grant Morrison. Ha drew two issues, but the project stalled after the second issue, as DC needed Morrison to concentrate his efforts on Batman rather than on Wildstorm projects.In a December 2013 interview, Ha announced a sabbatical from work for hire comics and expressed his desire to focus on creator-owned projects.In June 2015, Dark Horse Comics selected for publication Ha's creator-owned series Mae, which Ha funded through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter. The Mae fundraising campaign, which was for a 68-page Mae graphic novel written and illustrated by Ha, launched on April 24, reaching its $22,000 goal in 36 hours, and concluding with a total of $75,643. The book, however, will be published as an ongoing series rather than as a graphic novel. A portal fiction story, it depicts sisters Abbie and Mae, recently reunited following Abbie's disappearance eight years earlier into a fantasy world of monsters, who have followed her back to her world in pursuit of her. The series holds a 7.8 out of 10 rating at the review aggregator website Comic Book Round Up, based on 35 reviews.\nHa and his wife Lisa live in Berwyn, Illinois.\n"

His <<<voice did not change drastically during puberty>>>. As a result, he <<<was able to produce high-pitched sounds with ease>>>. Unfortunately, his <<<time spent during his youth was rather unpleasant>>>. He <<<remembers his puberty as being a time of defeat, helplessness, and tearfulness>>>. He <<<held a self-image as an outsider>>>, which <<<had a deep influence on his self-esteem, even after passing through puberty>>>. <<<These experiences are an important and prominent theme in>>> Guckkasten's <<<music world, particularly in the first of their regular albums>>>. <<<At the end of first grade in high school>>>, Ha <<<lost his girlfriend to his friend>>>. He <<<was greatly shocked and started singing, to change his impression>>>. He practiced \"She's Gone\" hard for the high school festival. He <<<got a good response>>>, and he <<<decided to work on music>>>. Sadly, he <<<did not study music formally>>> because his <<<father opposed him working on music>>>. On the other hand, Ha also liked to draw cartoons. Thanks to his mother who had dreamed of a painter, he was able to learn art when he was in high school, which was quite late. His father opposed art as well as music, but he eventually let Ha go to the college to study art. He quit music for a while after entering the university. Although his life in the university was short, his interest in art and aesthetics also became a driving force for image music in the future by forming a big axis in Guckkasten's music. He designed all of Guckkasten's albums himself.\n"

Ha <<<then became a Christian>>>. His poetry became an artistic stimulus for artists in parts of England and America.\nHa became a Presbyterian minister and a professor of historical theology at Korea Presbyterian Theological Seminary. He teaches Biblical Exposition. Ha established Korea Presbyterian Church and the Korea Presbyterian Seminary, serving as Pastoral General, Christian education, Missions etc., at his own expense.\n\nHa presented the historical point of view of the Orthodox Church, describing how the confession of faith and the historical context coincide.

(Honors)>>> from the University of Wisconsin <<<in geography>>> in 1969 and a<<< geography M.A.>>> from San Diego State University in 1971; Haack <<<received a Ph.D. in geography>>> from the University of Michigan in 1977. While at San Diego State University working as a teaching assistant for Dr. William Finch, a pioneer in the field of remote sensing, Haack <<<was introduced to the study of the earth through aircraft and satellite imagery>>>. That interest was the primary reason Haack chose to attend the University of Michigan; in Ann Arbor, Haack studied under professors Thomas Detwyler, Charles Olsen, and Waldo Tobler.\nWhile a graduate student at the University of Michigan, Haack was employed by the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM), initially as a research assistant and later as a research scientist. ERIM was one of the leading remote sensing organizations in the world at the time. At ERIM, Haack was involved in a number or research projects. Those that most influenced his career involved the transfer of satellite based remote sensing to developing countries. With other ERIM scientists, Haack traveled to Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh for multiple presentations and collection of field data. One of the specific projects was to employ Landsat satellite imagery to evaluate winter rice distribution in Bangladesh using regression analysis estimation techniques. Because his professional goal was to enter academia, Haack left ERIM to take a faculty position in geography at Ball State University in Indiana in 1978. While teaching in Indiana, Haack also served as an instructor for USAID workshops on technology transfer of remote sensing in Swaziland and Kenya.\nAs a basic research academic, Haack was one of the initial remote sensing scientists to integrate data from optical and radar sensors. Many of his publications are based upon this research activity. Early in his academic career, Haack had fellowships at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at the California Institute of Technology. It was at JPL in 1981 that Haack first integrated optical and radar data and began publishing scientific articles on the topic.\nAs an extension of his Africa workshop participations, in 1981 Haack was offered a position as a remote sensing expert at the USAID funded Regional Remote Sensing Facility (RRSF) in Nairobi and worked there until 1983. RRSF served about 27 countries in East and Southern Africa on the technology transfer of primarily Landsat imagery through training programs, demonstration projects, and distribution of imagery. While at the RRSF, Haack began to employ satellite imagery to monitor the Omo River Delta in Lake Turkana. \nDuring the 1980s, Haack received funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to work with Sudanese scientists to evaluate the utility of spaceborne radar for mapping in Sudan. Haack and his students frequently used the second largest city in Sudan, Wad Madani, along the Blue Nile and associated large Gezira irrigation area as a study site. \nIn 1984 he began to conduct remote sensing training for a USAID-funded National Remote Sensing Centre in Kathmandu, Nepal. That experience led to at least 15 additional professional visits to Nepal for remote sensing and GIS initiatives.Haack was appointed Associate Professor of Geographic and Cartographic Sciences in the Geography Program at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia in 1985. He taught courses in physical geography and remote sensing as well as served as an advisor for master and doctoral students. Many of his students obtained prominent positions in science, policy, and intelligence areas both in the federal government and commercial companies as well as entering academia.\nHaack also taught remote sensing workshops for NASA and other federal agencies, the European Space Agency in The Netherlands and at multiple international venues including Syria, Afghanistan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Peru, Suriname, and Ecuador. For the academic year 1994-1995, Haack was a Fulbright Professor in the Department of Geography at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. While in Dar es Salaam and with scientists from Kenya and Tanzania, Haack obtained NASA support to evaluate combined radar and optical satellite imagery to study refugee camps. One of the camps later visited was Dadaab in Eastern Kenya.\nIn addition to the international technology transfer activities already cited, Haack has also been supported by USDA, USGS, US Census, World Bank, United Nations, National Geographic Society, US Air Force, International Union for the Conservation of Nature, International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, InterAmerican Development Bank, and directly by foreign governmental entities. Those activities have included program development and evaluation, training, as well as basic and applied science. Other professionally visited countries include Indonesia, Fiji, Mozambique, Thailand, China, Namibia, Malawi, Zambia, and Ethiopia.\nHaack was involved in national mapping activities in multiple countries. In Afghanistan, that effort was in support of the evaluation and improvement of the agricultural sector. A specific focus was changes in the Helmand-Arghandab irrigation scheme. His multiple activities in Suriname included advising on the conversion of all land ownership information to digital format as well as the social environmental impact of a proposed bauxite mine in the interior rainforest. In Nepal, he mapped urban expansion in the Kathmandu Valley and was the Chief Technical Advisor for a large international programme to develop improved management tools for the high mountains including Mount Everest. \nHaack has been on the editorial board for several scientific journals, including GIScience and Remote Sensing. He has also been active his entire career with the major scientific organization in his field, ASPRS. In 2006, Haack was elected a Fellow in ASPRS on the first ballot, a significant recognition in his scientific community.\n"

They sought to organize the pictorial surface without using traditional devices.\nAlthough their methods differed greatly, most of the work was monochromatic, geometric, kinetic, and gestural.

Condensation Cube (1963\u201365) embodies a physical occurrence, of the condensation cycle, in real time. Some of the themes in these works from the 1960s include the interactions of physical and biological systems, living animals, plants, and the states of water and the wind. He also made forays into land art, but by the end of the 1960s, his art had found a more specific focus.\n"

            "early_life": "Jan Haag (n\u00e9e Smith), born in Marysville, WA, grew up in the Pacific Northwest, graduated from Seattle's Holy Names Academy, and <<<went on to study art and painting>>> at Burnley School for Professional Art. Haag <<<continued her studies>>> at the Art Institute of Chicago, Reed College in Portland, Oregon, The New School for Social Research in New York, University of Washington, Pennsylvania State University, UCLA, and Southwestern University School of Law. Haag also <<<studied painting>>> with Frederick E. Smith, <<<dance>>> with Eleanor King, and <<<singing and tabla>>> with Ali Akbar Khan and Swapan Chaudhuri.\nIn Seattle, Haag managed poetry readings, an art gallery, and the Shakespeare Workshop for ABC Bookstore. As an actress, she performed in regional theaters during the 1950s and 1960s, and directed plays in Washington, Oregon and California. Haag has exhibited her work in West Coast museums, competitions, and galleries\u2014including the Seattle Art Museum, the Frye Museum, the Otto Seligman Gallery, and the Woessner Gallery.\nIn Los Angeles, Haag served as Film and Television Director for the John Tracy Clinic, where she directed a series of forty-two films, \"Teaching Speech to the Profoundly Deaf,\" for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. In 1971 she joined the staff of the American Film Institute where, as Director of National Production Programs, she administered the nation's largest film granting program, the Independent Filmmaker Program, funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1974, with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, she founded AFI's Directing Workshop for Women, a program in which accomplished women\u2014such as Joanne Woodward, Lee Grant, Margot Kidder, Ellen Burstyn, Maya Angelou, Karen Arthur, Anne Bancroft, Dyan Cannon, Julie Phillips, Kathleen Nolan, Cicely Tyson, Brianne Murphy, Nessa Hyams, and Randa Haines could develop their directing skills. The DWW became the fountainhead back to which the careers of many women, now directing film and television, can be traced. Haag also served on the boards of many film festivals/programs, including the Bellevue Film Festival, Filmex, the Sundance Institute, and the International Women Filmmakers Symposium.\nBetween 1975 and 2008, Haag created twenty-three needlepoint canvases, working on some of these simultaneously. One work took ten years to complete. The more complex of these canvases required hundreds, sometimes thousands of hours of application. An accomplished painter and poet familiar with different mediums, Haag writes of the textile art medium: \u201cCompared with the roughhouse immediacy of painting and sculpture, one can cite many a rug, tapestry, piece of stitchery which took a year to make or, at times, a decade. Back and back and back, millennia by millennia, the history and lore of weaving/stitchery recedes as we, at the near end of the time scale, proceed -- cloth, grid arts, fractals and computer -- into the future.\u201d\nHaag explains: \u201cOver the years, working on these pieces has become one of my primary ways of understanding both the world and my experience of it. The works\u2026 transmit knowledge. Not only the powerful subjective awareness of light and color, but the pleasure associated with study -- in this case, study of music, astronomy, mathematics, travel, archaeology, and the iconographic, mystical and esoteric traditions of many cultures.\u201dThese textile pieces became a life\u2019s work. Through determined experimentation and applying techniques and iconography learned from a lifetime of travel, including treks on foot alone through India, Korea, China, Thailand, Nepal, Russia and Europe, Haag would forever change the perceptions and possibilities of needlepoint.In 1982, Haag retired from AFI to focus on her art and writing. She has written thousands of poems and given poetry readings in theaters, museums, libraries, galleries, and private salons. A limited edition of \"Amanita Caesarea\", a legend, with original drawings by Roger Landry, was published by Gallery Plus in Los Angeles. Haag has written stories, novels, plays, film scripts, articles, essays, and a vast journal\u2014the manuscripts of which are on deposit in Special Collections at the Blagg Huey Library of Texas Woman's University in Denton, TX. Haag's travel stories have appeared in four of the prize-winning Traveler's Tales series of books: India, A Woman's World, The Spiritual Gifts of Travel, and Spain. During a 1991 writer's fellowship at the Syvenna Foundation in Texas, Haag wrote a novel Cantalloc. In 1992, during a writer's fellowship at Blue Mountain Center in New York, she completed No Palms, a California/Texas novel centering on water rights, real estate fraud, and murder. After 50 years of research and study, in 2009, Haag published Jocasta, an original play based on the Oedipus myth seen from Jocasta's point of view. Ascesis, a 600-page volume of poetry, was published in 2014.\nHaag was married for ten years, 1957\u201368, to John Haag, Professor and Poet-in-Residence at Pennsylvania State University. Haag currently resides within the Seattle metropolitan area.\n"

She <<<has held numerous fellowships>>>, including a Mellon Fellowship in the Humanities, a National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship, and postdoctoral positions at both Brown and Rutgers universities.\nHaag\u2019s essays, books, and opinion address a broad range of topics.Her first book was a scholarly monograph, Consent: Sexual Rights and the Transformation of American Liberalism (Cornell University Press, 1999). It discusses the \"transition from classic to modern liberalism, and the cultural emergence of a concept of a right to privacy and sexual liberty, decades before the concept became legally prominent in the late 1900s\".Haag was the Director of Research for the AAUW Educational Foundation for five years and, while there, published research on girls' insights about their challenges in school life, called \"Voices of a Generation\" (Marlowe, 2000).Marriage Confidential: Love in the Post-Romantic Age (HarperCollins, 2012), is cultural commentary about the state of 21st-century marriage. It explores the dilemma of the \"semi-happy\" couple\u2014not miserable in marriage but not content, either\u2014and it discusses how some couples are redefining marriage. Among others, The Washington Post reviewed it as \"flat-out brilliant\"; Publishers Weekly gave it a starred review, and it was chosen by the Huffington Post as one of the notable and important books of the season.\nThe Gunning of America: Business and the Making of American Gun Culture (Basic Books, 2016) highlights the gun industry rather than gun owners. The book delves into the historical archives of the Winchester and Colt\u2019s corporations, and the ghostly legend of gun heiress Sarah Winchester. Gunning argues among other things that the gun mystique truly flourished and developed not on the frontier of the 1800s but in the urban, modern, \u201cpost-frontier\u201d America of the 1900s.  Haag pays particular attention to how the gun industry itself worked to build markets, both in the U.S. and, crucially, abroad.  She argues that the gun shifted from something that Americans needed but didn't especially love in the 1800s to something that they loved but didn't especially need in the 1900s.The Gunning of America was praised as \"beautifully composed\", \"brilliant\", \"remarkable\", and \"masterful\" in reviews, including The New Republic, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, the San Francisco Chronicle, The New York Review of Books, Maclean's, Time, and others. It received a starred review in Publishers Weekly.The Gunning of America was named a best book of 2016 by Kirkus Reviews, The Washington Post, and the San Francisco Chronicle, and an outstanding academic title by Choice. It was excerpted in The Wall Street Journal, Politico, and Salon.Haag has also published in places such as: The American Scholar, NPR, The Christian Science Monitor, Slate, Huffington Post, Ms., The Washington Post, The Chronicle of Higher Education, New York Post, Michigan Quarterly Review, The Antioch Review, New Haven Review, and The Times (London), as well as peer-reviewed academic journals.

Looking back on the experience, he remarked, \"<<<I wondered why I had traveled to the other side of the world to learn about Alutiiq history and culture when I could be doing the same thing at home>>>.\" Haakanson spent a year in Russia while a UAF undergraduate in 1991. He taught English in the port town of Magadan on Russia\u2019s northeast coast. While in Magadan he <<<became interested in the Nenet people of the Yamal Peninsula>>>. <<<Parts of their history are the content of his 2000 doctoral dissertation>>> at Harvard University.\nHaakanson <<<continued his studies as a graduate student in anthropology>>> at Harvard University in 1992, <<<receiving his MA>>> in 1996 <<<and PhD>>> in 2000.

During his school days he was a member of the Junior Engineering Technical Society and was made the zonal project manager to represent Delta State. \nIn 1992, as a young kid, he met the first executive governor of Delta State Olorogun Felix Ibru after he exhibited unusual creativity for someone who grew up in the village to have the innovation to design a hovercraft ship, radio transmitter, hair dryer, projector, electric solar table fan, and flying helicopter, that made him the first African child to have built a flying helicopter and a moving hovercraft ship. He was awarded a scholarship to study structural engineering at New York University.\nAccording to his mother, Princess Emily, his insight into the life and the future were mysterious, because he professed issues about the future and he had a great inherent spirituality that made him scared.\n<<<Through his passion for comedy>>>, he <<<gained wide acceptance and popularity within a short while>>>. Based on what he witnessed growing up in the village as a young kid, he took his success as a means to address mitigating factors affecting young children and many unprivileged people.\nHe came up with the name I Go dye from the similarity of the sound of his surname Agoda, I GO DYE, translated to mean initiative guide on developing youth endowment.\nWhen in college, his mother removed him from the United College of Commerce to Essi College, Warri, so that his uncle, who was a teacher in Essi College, could monitor his activities.\n<<<While in>>> Essi <<<College>>>, he joined SVC where he <<<meet his best friend of today>>> Otagware Onodjeyeke (Ltas) now known as Igosave.

He became the most salable comedian according to the marketer, Obino Music. He performed for a decade and was eventually honored by Opa Williams, the producer of Night of a Thousand Laugh, as the most outstanding comedian to have been on the stage of Night of a Thousand Laugh for ten years.His first European tour was with Ehi Zoya Golden Entertainment (2005), which took him around 7 countries.

            "early_life": "Byiome Muir grew up in Sandy Bay, a small community east of May Pen in Clarendon Parish, Jamaica. Muir attended Palmers Cross All-Age School and then Garvey Maceo High School, and <<<would often sing and make noises during class>>>. Muir briefly attended Knox Community College with a focus on architecture, but dropped out to <<<pursue his recording career full-time>>>. Muir <<<began his recording career at the age of 16>>>, when he was introduced to Donovan Germain of Penthouse Records, then manager of such artists as Buju Banton and Assassin. Muir released his first singles, \"Oh Jah\" and \"Stepp a Seed\", in 2000 at Penthouse Records under the moniker Richie Rich.  After meeting Junior Arrows of the Arrows Recording Company, Muir signed onto the Kingston label under the new name I-Octane, a play on high-octane fuel and the Rastafarian use of I.  I-Octane's initial acclaim came in 2007 for his social commentary works such as the roots reggae track \"Stab Vampire\" which climbed to the top of several Jamaican charts.  In 2009, I-Octane topped the charts again with his emotional songs \"Mama You Alone\" and \"Lose A Friend\", and the latter of which was later adapted as a tribute to those who died during the police manhunt for Christopher \"Dudus\" Coke in Tivoli Gardens.When I-Octane left Arrows over financial disputes, the artist came under the guidance of Robert Livingston, a veteran producer who had been responsible for the success of such artists as Super Cat and Shaggy.  I-Octane gained further traction in 2010 with a string of hits produced by Cashflow Records, including \"No Love Inna Dem\" and the cannabis anthem \"Puff It,\" which was named as one of NPR's Top 5 Dancehall Tracks of 2011.  He also topped the charts once again with the contemplative \"My Life\" produced by DJ Frass, and was featured in the April\u2013May issue of the hip hop magazine Vibe.  The same year, he also signed on as Brand Ambassador for the telecommunications firm Digicel, and as of 2013 he remains employed as a representative of the company. I-Octane has also been the Brand Ambassador for the Golden Eagle Brand in Jamaica since 2015.\nIn 2011, I-Octane announced he would be starting his own record label, Conquer The Globe Productions, which would serve to produce instrumentals for him and promote him as an artist.  He also said the label's first release would be an extended play in December of that year to be followed by an album in early 2012.  The six-song EP, \"Straight From The Heart,\" was released on 7 December as a primarily digital release, with distribution by TuneCore.  The EP was marketed towards a global audience and three of its songs were recorded in the U.S., a first for the artist.  The EP's lead single \"Burn Dem Bridge,\" produced by Stephen \"Di Genius\" McGregor, topped several charts in Jamaica and received significant radio airplay, including on international stations such as New York's Hot 97.I-Octane's debut album, Crying To The Nation, was released on 13 February 2012 through Robert Livingston's Scikron Entertainment in the Caribbean and VP Records internationally.  The album received generally positive reviews from critics.  Rick Anderson of AllMusic praised the record as a \"solid winner\", but mentioned it relied a little too strongly on Auto-Tune, and David Katz of BBC Music called the album \"a surprisingly varied set, comprising mostly new roots reggae in the one drop style, along with a couple of rougher-edged tracks in full-on dancehall mode\".  The album's lead single was the lovers rock ballad \"L.O.V.E. Y.O.U.\", which was marketed to international audiences but also did well domestically.  I-Octane followed the album with a tour of the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and ended the year strong with a string of hit singles, including \"Badmind Dem A Pree\", a collaboration with Bounty Killer produced by Buju Banton's son Markus Myrie, the summer hit \"Love Di Vibes\", and the Seanizzle-produced \"Gal A Gimmi Bun\", a song in which I-Octane laments his partner's infidelity.In March 2013, I-Octane was selected as brand ambassador for the Caribbean soft drink Busta, a product of S. M. Jaleel and Company.His second album, the DJ Frass-produced My Journey, was released in March 2014 on Tad's International Records. He continued to work with DJ Frass on the 2015 EP New Chapter.In March 2018, I-Octane's Love and Life album was released and debuted at #3 on the reggae Billboard where it stayed for 3 weeks. The Album was produced executively by I-Octane under his Conquer The Globe Production label, he worked with a new of producers and artistes.\nIn 2021 he released the album Moods, followed by I am Great (2022), which was preceded by the single \"Sorry\".\n"

Since 1978 he has been at Yale University, where he is at present J. W. Gibbs professor for physics and chemistry.\nIachello received the Chiaudano prize in 1968  and was a Fulbright Fellow in 1964. He was awarded in 1990 the Wigner Medal, in 1991 both the Taormina Prize and the Dutch AKZO Prize, and in 1993, along with Akito Arima, the Tom W. Bonner Prize of the American Physical Society. Iachello became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996. He is also member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences. In 1997 he received the Centennial Prize of the Italian Physical Society. In 2002 he received the Meitner Prize of the European Physical Society. He has honorary doctorates from the University of Ferrara, the University of Seville, and Chung Yuan University in China.\nIachello is famous for the application of algebraic methods (Lie algebras) to the investigation of the spectra of atomic nuclei and molecules. In 1974 with Akito Arima he introduced the \"Interacting Boson Model\" into nuclear physics. This important model describes collective nuclear states with the help of the unitary group U(6). The underlying concept is to derive a model with pairs of neutrons and protons instead of unpaired nucleons. The pairs are treated as bosons with different quantum spin (s- and d- bosons, as named according to spin 0 and 2). In an extension of the model, the analogous effect with unpaired fermions has a description using supersymmetrical algebras.In recent times he has worked mainly on the investigation of the quantum mechanical dynamics of molecules (e.g. quantum phase transitions, polymer dynamics) with algebraic methods, on which Iachello already began to work in 1981 (Vibron Model).\n"

Iacobucci <<<earned a bachelor's degree (honours) in economics>>> from Queen's University, <<<a Master of Philosophy degree>>>, also <<<in economics>>>, from the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and <<<a Bachelor of Laws>>> from the University of Toronto. From 1996 to 1997, he <<<clerked for>>> John Sopinka, <<<a justice of the Supreme Court>>> of Canada.\nIacobucci joined the University of Toronto Faculty of Law in 1998. In 2002, he was a John M. Olin visiting fellow at Columbia University Law School. He has also been a visiting professor at New York University Law School and the University of Chicago Law School.In 2003, Iacobucci, along with Paul Collins, Michael Trebilock, and Ralph Winter won the Canadian Economics Association's Doug Purvis Memorial Prize for their book The Law and Economics of Canadian Competition Policy.In 2011, Iacobucci was appointed as the C. D. Howe Institute's Competition Policy Scholar, and was reappointed to that position in 2015. Iacobucci, along with Lawson Hunter and Michael Trebilcock were co-authors in a 2014 C.D. Howe Institute study called \"Let the Market Decide: The Case against Mandatory Pick-And-Pay\" about the Canadian telecommunications and broadcasting industry.In 2016, during Iacobucci's tenure as dean, the University of Toronto Faculty of Law created the J.R. Kimber Chair for Investment Rights, which was the first research chair for investor rights in North America; the position was first held by future federal cabinet minister Anita Anand.Iacobucci is an independent member of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC)'s board of directors and the chair of its Corporate Governance Committee.Mid-September 2020 articles in the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail  \u2014based on interviews and corroborated by correspondence between the university and faculty staff\u2014alleged that Iacobucci had rescinded an offer to legal scholar Valentina Azarova to become the director of the faculty's International Human Rights Program (IHRP), under pressure from Justice David Spiro, a member of the Tax Court of Canada, who is an alumnus of and donor to the university. According to the Star , Azarova\u2014who was the faculty advisory board's \"unanimous choice\"\u2014had accepted the offer of the IHRP directorship in mid-August. In a mid-September letter to Iacobucci, two former IHRP directors, told the dean, that the Tax Court judge had expressed his concerns about Azarova's research on Israeli occupation\u2014specifically her criticism of Israel's settlements in Palestine\u2014to the administration. Shortly after, Azarova's offer was rescinded. A University of Haifa Faculty of Law associate professor, said that Azarova's  criticism of Israel and the settlements was not \"exotic\", but rather a \"kind of majority position around the world\"\u2014a \"long-standing criticism\" of \"human rights violations of international law\". In protest, the entire advisory board resigned en masse. In an October 14 email,  Dean Iacobucci told professors that he had ordered an impartial review of the hiring process which will result in a January 2021 report. The announcement came amid calls from \"lawyers, academics, rights groups and public intellectuals from around the world\" for an independent review. The Canadian Judicial Council is \"considering multiple complaints\" against Justice Spiro. According to the Globe and Mail, Justice Spiro and his extended family, including the Tanenbaum's, have been generous donors over the years to the university. Dean Iacobucci denies any wrongdoing and says the reason for rescinding the offer to Azarova was related to an immigration technicality. The pro-Israel B'nai Brith Canada's CEO, Michael Mostyn said that preventing Azarova hiring was a \"sound decision.\" The Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) voted to censure U of T in protest of the external interference on academic freedom. The censure requested academics not to accept job offers or attend conferences and events at the university until Dr. Azarova's offer was reinstated. As a result of the censure, several events at the university were cancelled or postponed, including the UofT Tedx conference. Groups that support the censure include Amnesty International, the National Lawyers Guild, the Indigenous Education Network, and the HIV Legal Network.In December 2020, the Faculty of Law announced that Jutta Brunn\u00e9e would succeed Iacobucci as dean, starting January 2021.\n"

She <<<was later mentored by>>> Leopoldo Presas, <<<a member of the>>> Academia Nacional de Bellas Artes de Argentina (<<<National Academy of Fine Arts>>>) and President of Sociedad Argentina de Artistas Pl\u00e1sticos. She also studied with Julio G\u00fcero, Maria Luisa Manasero, and Ana Eckell, who represented Argentina at 1997 Venice Biennale. She completed her school education at Northlands School and <<<got her college degree at the>>> Santa Ana <<<School of Fine Arts>>> in Buenos Aires in 1980. Later Iacona attended the Sorbonne in Paris.\nDuring the 80s, Iacona moved to Punta del Este, Uruguay where she worked as a professional landscape designer planning and designing gardens and parks. This later became the basis of her floral art. She would work during the day, and paint at night. Her flowers are a synthesis of what she sees, rather than photorealistic renditions of her subjects.In the late 80s Iacona moved back to Argentina where she started showing her paintings in Buenos Aires galleries. She also participated in the Centro de Arte y Comunicaci\u00f3n (CAYC) Biennal organized by art critic Jorge Glusberg. In 1990, the Argentine Museo Nacional de Arte Decorativo selected one of her works, Sunset Flowers, as a state present to China. It became one of the first works by an Argentinian artist in the Hangzhou Art Center's collection.\nIn 1992 she moved to Kinsale, Ireland to participate in a collective exhibition which lead to a year of work there. In 1993, she moved to Paris to work on her flower artworks and commissioned portraits. Her work then took her to America where she first lived in Austin, Texas, where she worked on a site-specific work for a Catholic chapel. After Austin, she spent two years in New Orleans, before moving to New York in 1996 where she continued to work till 1999. In 1998, one of her works was selected to participate in the Sal\u00f3n Nacional de Artes Pl\u00e1sticas at Palais de Glace, Buenos Aires. That year, the exhibition was held in the city of Paran\u00e1, Entre R\u00edos.\nWith the nomination for Sal\u00f3n Nacional, she traveled to Argentina and decided to stay and reconnect with her Argentine roots and fellow artists. She studied aesthetics with professor and researcher Lucas Salvador Fragasso. \"El debate est\u00e9tico contempor\u00e1neo\" (Contemporary Aesthetics Debate) evolved around concepts such as aesthetic experience, artistic autonomy, artwork analysis based on philosophic texts from Adorno, Benjamin, Heidegger and others such as Hal Foster, Georges Didi-Huberman and Rosalind Krauss. In 2000 she gave birth to her daughter. During that period, she started painting flowers on larger canvases and many of her works focused on pop portraits of children, commissioned by friends and others. By 2014, requests for commissioned works from Europe had accumulated and she and her daughter moved to London, returning to Argentina in 2016.\n"

He grew up living with his mother, his uncle and his grandparents. <<<At a young age>>>, Iaconelli <<<was introduced to fishing on summer trips>>> to the Pocono Mountains. <<<On these trips>>>, he <<<was first introduced to other types of fishing besides bass fishing>>>. His <<<first experiences were with trout and various panfish species>>>. His <<<first largemouth bass catch came at age twelve during his family's annual summer trek to the>>> Pocono <<<Mountains>>>. Iaconelli <<<used a 9S Floating Rapala lure to catch the bass>>>. According to Iaconelli, <<<this moment sparked his interest in bass fishing>>>. His <<<love for bass fishing continued on into high school>>>.\nAfter high school, Iaconelli founded the bass fishing club, \"Top Rod Bassmasters\". Top Rod Bassmasters became Iaconelli's first venture into competitive bass fishing. The club had inter-club tournaments among its members. In 1992, after three years of fishing in Top Rod Bassmasters, Iaconelli made the transition to the pro-am circuit. His first tournament on this circuit was the North Carolina Top 100. This event was held on  Lake Norman in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. In this tournament, Iaconelli drew widely known fisherman, Tommy Biffle.  In the following days of the North Carolina Top 100, he would also draw well-known fishermen David Fritts and Gary Klein. In 1994, Iaconelli once again fished the North Carolina Top 100 on Lake Norman. At this tournament, he won his first bass boat. The boat he won was a new Ranger 374.After Iaconelli won a Ranger 374, he began to tackle the Red Man and Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (B.A.S.S.) Federation trails. In 1997, Iaconelli fished a B.A.S.S. Invitational Tournament on Buggs Island, also known as Kerr Lake. The first day, he was paired with the four-time Bassmaster Classic champion, Kevin VanDam. One of Iaconelli's earliest tournament victories came on New Jersey's Lake Hopatcong. In this Federation tournament, he broke the lake and one-day Federation record of just over 18 pounds. His official weight for that tournament was 19.58 lbs.In 1999, Iaconelli qualified for the Bassmaster Federation Nationals on the Red River. He would go on to win the event as he qualified for the 1999 Bassmaster Classic berth after the victory. The 1999 Bassmaster Classic was held on the Louisiana Delta in New Orleans, Louisiana. At the 1999 Bassmaster Classic, Classic rookie Iaconelli caught a three-day total of 39 lbs and 12 oz. That total netted him a sixth-place finish. The great finish at the Bassmaster Classic culminated in Dick's Sporting Goods and Daiwa becoming major sponsors for Iaconelli.  In September of the same year, Iaconelli collected his first victory in the professional ranks by winning the Bassmaster Vermont Top 150 on Lake Champlain. Michael Iaconelli bagged over 61 lbs of bass and a $100,000 check. In 2000, Iaconelli made the leap to the professional ranks. He began fishing the B.A.S.S Tour.    Again, Iaconelli qualified for the Bassmaster Classic. The 2000 Bassmaster Classic was held on Lake Michigan in Chicago, Illinois. He was able to net a top finish with a three-day weight total of 20 lbs 1 oz.In 2002, Iaconelli started the season with a victory on Lake Seminole. The victory on Lake Seminole was the first Tour level victory for Iaconelli.  He qualified for the 2003 Bassmaster Classic after a ninth-place victory at the B.A.S.S. Invitational on Lake Ontario.\n-Bassmaster: http://www.bassmaster.com/anglers/michael-iaconelli\n-Major League Fishing: https://www.majorleaguefishing.com/angler-detail/mike-iaconelli/5388\n-Fishing League Worldwide (FLW): https://web.archive.org/web/20120305061103/http://www.flwoutdoors.com/community/profile/home.cfm?uid=102108\nMike is married to Rebecca \"Becky\" Iaconelli and he has four children: Drew, Rylie, Vegas, and Estella.

She entered Arizona State University in 2005, with the initial interest of filming and directing or becoming an astronaut but <<<quickly became fascinated by geology>>>. In her sophomore year, she <<<began working for and researching with petrologist>>> Gordon Moore. She <<<then pursued her doctoral degree>>> at the University of Cambridge.\nIacovino's work has involved carefully negotiated diplomatic relations with countries such as North Korea. During one of these trips, she worked alongside a team of their scientists as the only woman involved. She was the first female scientist to ever conduct traveling research in North Korea and was also the only American on this expedition. Iacovino is part of a small group of women in volcanology, but is highly respected for her work ethic and strength.Iacovino's work in North Korea is part of an international effort (which includes American, British, North Korean, and Chinese colleagues) to understand Mount Paektu, an volcano located on the border between North Korea and China. The work is led by British scientists Clive Oppenheimer (Iacovino's PhD supervisor) and James Hammond and was recently featured in the Werner Herzog documentary \"Into the Inferno\". The group's work has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Notably, the publications include both western and North Korean co-authors.In 2012, Iacovino also studied Erta Ale in Ethiopia. During this, her team was the target of a high-profile attempt to capture and imprison Westerners. Due to a delay in traveling, this was not successful - although several other tourists were harmed.Currently, Iacovino is working for NASA. Iacovino was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at Arizona State University. Iacovino previously held a National Science Foundation Post-Doctoral Fellowship at the United States Department of the Interior US Geological Survey. She recreates magma chambers with experimental petrology, characterizes rock samples, measures volcanic degassing, and performs thermodynamic modeling.She has also published articles in scientific journals, lectured at universities such as Arizona State University, and presented around the world. Additionally, she received many research grants, including the AAAS Research Grant most recently.\nIacovino is the Editor-in-Chief of TrekMovie.com, as a longstanding Star Trek fan. She believes that science fiction is a useful tool in helping the public gain interest in science. She was also inspired by  Kate Mulgrew's character - the first female captain of Star Trek. Mulgrew has since met with Iacovino and noted that unlike Iacovino, she \"only played one [scientist] on TV.\"Iacovino is involved in encouraging young women to pursue STEM careers, such as with projects like the Curiosity Science Program created through a Gold Award Project by one of BBC's 100 Women of 2016, Erin McKenney. In this program, Iacovino described her own career as one that requires curiosity, interest in the world, and a willingness to get your hands dirty. In a separate interview, her advice to people interested in volcanology was, \"Follow your heart, and see what path that leads you down and find something that you\u2019re passionate about.\"\n"

From 1955 to 1960, Iacovou was a student in the United Kingdom and <<<was active in student politics and Greek Cypriot community affairs>>>.\nFrom 1960 until 1964, Iacovou worked in the private sector in Cyprus. He worked as a Senior Consultant at the international enterprise Price Waterhouse in London, as Principal Officer for Operational Research and later on as Senior Finance Officer of the board of directors for British Rail. In 1972, he returned to Cyprus from the United Kingdom, and was appointed Director of the Cyprus Productivity Centre, where he introduced new management methods in industry and commerce, pioneering programmes for continuing education of business executives, such as a post-graduate management course that has been running for over thirty years. He also turned his attention to the upgrading of skills of artisans and technicians in many fields. Concurrently, Iacovou was Chairman of the board of directors of the Hotel and Catering Institute of Cyprus (\"HCI\"), and under his stewardship, the HCI became internationally known, being acknowledged accordingly on the island.\nFollowing the Turkish invasion of 1974, he established and directed the \"Service for the Relief and Rehabilitation of Displaced Persons\" on directions from the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Cyprus. He later also established the \"Service for the Reintegration of Displaced Persons\". Iacovou's work for refugees has had an important impact on subsequent developments in Cyprus, including what has been dubbed the Cypriot \"economic miracle\". In this capacity, Iacovou became a close associate of Archbishop Makarios, the first President of the Republic of Cyprus. He also became one of the most articulate advocates of the rights of displaced persons in Cyprus, who form a core issue of the wider Cyprus problem. His work in the field has been nationally and internationally acknowledged, with his exposure to these people's problems influencing his subsequent career. Iacovou is considered one of the ablest administrators of Cyprus and is often referred to as the technocrat with the big heart. From April 1976 until January 1979, he served as Head of the Africa Department of the UN High Commission for Refugees in Geneva.\nFrom January 1979 until January 1983, he was Ambassador of the Cyprus Republic to the Federal Republic of Germany, with parallel accreditation to Austria and Switzerland; later on, he served as Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nOn 22 September 1983, he was appointed Foreign Minister and remained in this post until February 1993. His first appointment to this office came just before the illegal and unilateral declaration of \"independence\" by the Turkish Cypriot leadership in 1983. Nevertheless, he successfully pursued the condemnation of this action in the United Nations Security Council through the adoption of SC Resolutions 541 and 550. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, he negotiated Cyprus's Customs Union Agreement with the then European Economic Community (EEC) in 1987, and in 1990, he submitted the application of Cyprus to join the EEC. In 2003, Iacovou signed the Treaty of Accession of Cyprus to the European Union (\"EU\").\nLater on, he was appointed by the Greek government as President of the National Foundation for the Reception and Resettlement of Repatriated Greeks. His programme for the integration of several hundred thousand persons of Greek origin returning to Greece from the former Soviet Union was met with great success. Iacovou masterminded operation Golden Fleece, the liberation of fifteen hundred men, women and children of Greek origin from the besieged city of Sukhumi in Abkhazia; he later participated in a similar operation in the city of Groznyy, Chechnya. He also founded several university departments for the teaching of the Greek language in countries of the former Soviet Union.\n"

            ],
            "early_life": "Born in Farmingdale, New Jersey, Ian was raised on a farm, and attended East Orange High School in East Orange, New Jersey, and the New York City High School of Music & Art. Both sets of grandparents (from Kyiv, Ukraine; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; and Poland) lived in the New York-New Jersey area, having emigrated via England in about 1918. Her parents, Victor, a music teacher, and Pearl, a college fundraiser, were Jewish-born liberal atheists who ran several summer camps in upstate New York. As a child, Ian <<<admired the work of folk musicians>>> such as Joan Baez and Odetta. <<<Starting with piano lessons at the age of two (at her own insistence)>>>, Ian, <<<by the time she entered her teens, was playing the organ, harmonica, French horn and guitar>>>. <<<At the age of 12>>>, she <<<wrote her first song>>>, \"Hair of Spun Gold\", <<<which was subsequently published in the folk publication>>> Broadside and <<<was later recorded for her eponymous debut album>>>. In 1964, she legally changed her name to Janis Ian, taking her brother Eric's middle name as her new surname.\nAt the age of 14, Ian wrote and recorded her first hit single, \"Society's Child (Baby I've Been Thinking)\", about an interracial romance forbidden by a girl's mother and frowned upon by her peers and teachers. Produced by George \"Shadow\" Morton and released three times from 1965 to 1967, \"Society's Child\" became a national hit upon its third release after Leonard Bernstein featured it in a late-April 1967 CBS TV special titled Inside Pop: The Rock Revolution.The song's theme of interracial relationships was considered taboo by some radio stations, who withdrew or banned it from their playlists accordingly. In her 2008 autobiography Society's Child, Ian recalls receiving hate mail and death threats as a response to the song and mentions that a radio station in Atlanta that played it was burned down. In July 1967, \"Society's Child\" reached no. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single sold 600,000 copies and the album sold 350,000 copies.At the age of 16, Ian met comedian Bill Cosby backstage at a Smothers Brothers show where she was promoting \"Society's Child\". Since she was underage, she was accompanied by a chaperone while touring. After her set, Ian had been sleeping with her head on the lap of her chaperone (an older female family friend). According to Ian in a 2015 interview, she was told by her then manager that Cosby had interpreted their interaction as \"lesbian\" and as a result \"had made it his business\" to warn other television shows that Ian wasn't \"suitable family entertainment\" and \"shouldn't be on television\" because of her sexuality, thus attempting to blacklist her. Although Ian would later come out, she states that at the time of the encounter with Cosby she had only been kissed once, by a boy she had a crush on, in broad daylight at summer camp.Ian relates on her website that, although \"Society's Child\" was originally intended for Atlantic Records and the label paid for her recording session, Atlantic subsequently returned the master to her and quietly refused to release it. Ian relates that years later, Atlantic's president at the time, Jerry Wexler, publicly apologized to her for this. The single and Ian's 1967 debut album (which reached no. 29 on the charts) were finally released on Verve Forecast. In 2001, \"Society's Child\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, which honors recordings considered timeless and important to music history. Her first four albums were released on a double CD entitled Society's Child: The Verve Recordings in 1995.\n\n\"Society's Child\" stigmatized Ian as a one-hit wonder until her most successful US single, \"At Seventeen\", was released in 1975. \"At Seventeen\" is a bittersweet commentary on adolescent cruelty, the illusion of popularity and teenage angst, from the perspective of a narrator looking back on her earlier experience. The song was a major hit as it charted at no. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, hit number one on the Adult Contemporary chart and won the 1976 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Female, beating out Linda Ronstadt, Olivia Newton-John and Helen Reddy. Ian appeared as the first musical guest on the series premiere of Saturday Night Live on October 11, 1975, performing \"At Seventeen\" and \"In the Winter\". The album Between the Lines was also a smash and reached number one on Billboard\u2032s album chart. The album would be certified platinum for sales of over one million copies sold in the US. Another measure of her success is anecdotal: on Valentine's Day 1977, Ian received 461 valentine cards, having indicated in the lyrics to \"At Seventeen\" that she never received one as a teenager.\"Fly Too High\" (1979), produced by disco producer Giorgio Moroder, was Ian's contribution to the soundtrack of the Jodie Foster film Foxes and was also featured on Ian's 1979 album Night Rains. It also became another international hit, reaching number one in many countries, including South Africa, Belgium, Australia, Israel and the Netherlands, and going gold or platinum in those countries and others. Another country where Ian has achieved a high level of popularity is Japan: Ian had two Top 10 singles on the Japanese Oricon charts, \"Love Is Blind\" in 1976 and \"You Are Love\" in 1980. Ian's 1976 album Aftertones also topped Oricon's album chart in October 1976. \"You Are Love (Toujours Gai Mon Cher)\" is the theme song of Kinji Fukasaku's 1980 movie Virus. Ian cut several other singles specifically for the Japanese market, including 1998's \"The Last Great Place\".\nIn the US, Ian did not chart in the Top 40 on the pop charts after \"At Seventeen\", though she had several songs reach the Adult Contemporary singles chart through 1980 (all failing to make the Top 20).\nIan started Rude Girl Records, Inc., and its publishing arm, Rude Girl Publishing, on January 2, 1992. Since then, RGR has steadily grown, with its ownership of more than twenty-five Janis Ian albums and DVDs overseas, as well as hundreds of unreleased recordings and videos, including unreleased songs, concerts, demos, and rehearsal tapes. The Rude Girl label oversees the production of Ian's newer work, and in the case of older work, its re-mastering and the re-creation of the original artwork.From 1982\u201392, Ian continued to write songs, often in collaboration with then songwriting partner Kye Fleming, some of which have been covered by Amy Grant, Bette Midler, Marti Jones and other artists. She released Breaking Silence in 1993 and also came out as a lesbian.Other artists have recorded Ian's compositions, including Roberta Flack, who had a hit in 1973 with Ian's song \"Jesse\", which peaked at #19 on the Billboard pop charts on November 3, 1973. Ian's own version is included on her 1974 album Stars (the title song of which has also been oft-covered, including versions by Joan Baez, Shirley Bassey, Cher, Nina Simone and Barbara Cook). \"At Seventeen\" is Ian's most covered composition with 50 versions by artists including Celine Dion, Miki Howard and Julia Fordham. Ian's song \"In The Winter\" has also been covered many times by singers including Dusty Springfield and Sheena Easton. Richard Barone recorded Ian's song \"Sweet Misery\" on his album Sorrows & Promises: Greenwich Village in the 1960s in 2016. She continues to tour worldwide, though she stated that her 2022 North-American tour which was cancelled when a laryngitis diagnosis became severe would be her \"last full tour\".In August 2018 Ian performed at the UK's Cambridge Folk Festival.\nIan's mother Pearl Yadoff Fink was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1975. Because of this, Ian and her brother persuaded their mother to pursue her lifelong dream of going to college. Fink eventually enrolled in Goddard College's adult education program and ultimately graduated with a master's degree. After Fink's death in 1997, Ian decided to auction off memorabilia to raise money to endow a scholarship at Goddard specifically for older continuing education students, which became the Pearl Foundation, a 501(c)(3) public charity. At the end of each year, 90% or more of funds raised from sale of merchandise, donations from fans and contributions from Ian herself are disbursed to various educational institutions to fund scholarships. By 2020, it had endowed more than $1,250,000 in scholarship funds at four schools.Ian married Portuguese filmmaker Tino Sargo in 1978 and the two divorced in 1983. Accusations of Sargo's physical and emotional abuse were discussed in Ian's autobiography. After moving to Nashville, she met Patricia Snyder in 1989. Ian came out as a lesbian in 1993 with the worldwide release of her album Breaking Silence. Snyder and Ian married in Toronto on August 27, 2003. Ian has a stepdaughter and two grandchildren with Snyder.\n"

            "early_life": "J-Swift was born Juan Manuel Martinez-Luis in 1971 in Madrid, Spain. His Afro-Cuban <<<father>>>, Pedro, <<<was a salsa bandleader and multi-instrumentalist>>>. His mother, Dolores, was a native of the Canary Islands. In 1974, the family headed to Los Angeles, California, settling in Inglewood. At age six, J-Swift <<<enrolled in a piano conservatory, quickly proving to be a prodigy>>>. <<<The all-rap radio station>>> KDAY <<<introduced him to hip-hop>>> in the early 1980s, and the first record he ever got was by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.\nAround 1988, J-Swift attended Locke High School, where he <<<met his mentor R&B musician>>> Reggie Andrews, <<<producer>>> of Dazz Band's 1982 funk hit \"Let It Whip\" and collaborator of Rick James. <<<After>>> J-Swift <<<composed three new jack swing-style songs to get his attention>>>, Andrews <<<suggested that he concentrate on writing and producing>>>, and <<<set him up with a recording studio>>> (complete with a then-state-of-the-art Akai MPC60) <<<at South Central Unit (SCU), an after-school program for disadvantaged young talent>>>. <<<This gave>>> J <<<the opportunity to submit songs to>>> A&M Records' Rondor <<<Music publishing>>>, while additional work came via BMI's Cheryl Dickerson. Though much of this early music went unreleased (like an album by Bell Biv DeVoe spin-off STR8-Ahead), J-Swift's official songwriting/producing debut came in 1991 with Keisha Jackson's \"Feel You Out.\"\nAround this time J-Swift began making music with a crew of dancers-turned-rappers. With Reggie Andrews' record collection at their disposal, J-Swift and The Pharcyde crafted a three-song demo in '91 and subsequently a hip-hop classic, 1992's Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde. Featuring the hit single Passin' Me By, Pharcyde's debut went certified Gold. Disputes over production and credits caused a rift between J and the group (although they would later reunite on The Pharcyde's \"Trust\" remix in 2000, not to mention several J-Swift-produced tracks on Fatlip's 2005 solo debut The Loneliest Punk, and Fatlip and Tre Hardson's 2007 holiday song \"All I Want for Xmas\").\nWith his own \"Fat House Productions\" acts Jazzyfatnastees and Quinton, J-Swift signed an ill-fated million dollar deal with Tommy Boy Records in 1993. Another of his groups, The Wascals, dropped several singles including \"Class Clown\" and \"The Dips\" in '94, but broke up before releasing their debut. The crew was started by members Alfie and Buckwheed, the latter of which met J-Swift while they were going to high school together. (Wascals' Greatest Hits, completely produced by J-Swift, was finally released by Delicious Vinyl in 2007.) In the mid-'90s, J-Swift lent his signature style to a string of remixes, including Prince's \"Letitgo (Sherm Stick Edit),\" Massive Attack's \"Protection,\" and Urban Thermo Dynamics' \"Manifest Destiny\" (featuring a young Mos Def).\nJ-Swift was the subject of the 2007 documentary film 1 More Hit.J-Swift recorded new tracks from 2005 through 2010, providing not only the beats but also the rhymes. Featuring soul-baring rap confessionals (\"Off My Chest\") and tales of perseverance through struggles (\"Born To Win Despite Myself\") \u2014 while still celebrating recreational drug use (\"I'll Do Mine\") \u2014 J-Swift's new project began with an alter ego Negro Kanevil.\nIn 2006, J-Swift was arrested for possession of narcotics. In 2015, his permanent resident status was stripped and he was deported back to his birth country of Spain.\n"

Smash concert in Brooklyn, New York as a noteworthy pop and jazz concert in the New York metropolitan region.Not finding commercial success, J-Zone eventually walked away from rap, and in 2011 published the book Root for the Villain: Rap, Bullshit and a Celebration of Failure. The book has been well received; the Los Angeles Times Music Blog stated that \"Like his albums, it's equal parts hilarious, self-effacing and sharp. He's the sarcastic older brother putting you up on game. It's a love letter to rap laced with sulfur, the flip side of Dan Charnas' similarly excellent The Big Payback.\" The Washington Post Going Out Gurus blog called it \"a must for every curmudgeonly grown-up hip-hop head\", while Nathan Rabin writing for The A.V. Club called it \"one of the funniest and most honest books ever written about the modern music industry and its luckless casualties.\"In 2013, J-Zone returned to music with the release of the album, Peter Pan Syndrome, which was listed as the 17th best album of 2013 by Spin. After learning to play drums seriously during his hiatus from music, J-Zone released the drum break album, Lunch Breaks, in 2014.In 2016 J-Zone landed a spot playing drums on new tunes from the 1970s funk band Manzel, his band The Du-Rites with Tom Tom Club guitarist Pablo Martin, and for personal drum break kits for Danger Mouse and others.J-Zone has continued working as a session drummer in recent years, appearing on Lord Finesse's Motown State of Mind album in 2020, in addition to his drums being sampled on the 2020 Madlib single, \"Road of The Lonely Ones\".In 2022, J-Zone was the drummer for live shows and select recordings for The Black Pumas guitarist Adrian Quesada's Boleros Psicodelicos album.\n"

Holding the final shows in his hometown of New York, he became the first artist in history to sell out the legendary SOB's venue on three consecutive nights.

A week later he released a new single, \"Proud of Me\", along with an accompanying music video. After appearing on Lil Tjay's State of Emergency EP, he further collaborated with him in June on the single \"Hood Scars 2\", which served as a followup to J.I.'s original song which had by then amassed 15 million streams across all platforms.In July 2020 he came out with the single \"Spanglish\" with Puerto Rican rapper Myke Towers, with both artists mixing English and Spanish in their verses. It served as the lead single to his next EP, Welcome to GStarr Vol. 1, which he released on July 17 and also featured Lil Durk. In the first 20 minutes, it garnered 1.3 million streams on Spotify. A few days prior, Spotify announced a partnership with J.I. as a part of its recently launched RADAR program meant to promote \"world-class talent through [their] global marketing and editorial teams\" with placement in their official playlists, a mini-documentary, third-party partnerships, a Spotify Singles recording and support on the EP release.On November 30, 2020, his single \"Need Me\" was certified gold by the RIAA, his first career plaque.On December 18, 2020, J.I released Hood Life Krisis, Vol. 3, the third installment in his Hood Life Krisis series. The EP includes a sole guest appearance from A Boogie wit da Hoodie on the track \"R&B Shit\".\n"

However, shortly after her move she was spotted by Larry Pignagnoli and Davide Riva, the production team behind Whigfield. Simlat was quickly signed to and her first single, \"You Make Me Feel Good\", performed well in France, Italy and Germany and topped the dance charts in Canada.\nHer third single, \"You and I\", climbed to the top position on the Canadian dance charts and obtained strong airplay in continental Europe. The track was also used on many dance compilation albums around the globe, including Muchmusic's Dance Mix '95 and the Eurodisco '96 - Collection. A fourth single, \"My Radio\", took Europe by storm and also became popular in Japan.\nAlthough J.K.'s last official single, \"Deep in the Night\", was released in 1999, the Benassi Bros made two cover versions of J.K. songs with the vocalist Dhany in 2005 titled \"Hit My Heart\" and \"Make Me Feel\". Most singles were only released in Italy.\nIn reality, the vocals for J.K. were performed by Giovanna Bersola, Sandy Chambers and Zeitia Massiah on all the songs. Lip sync was performed on videos and live performances by Simlat. It was proven that Simlat was actually lip-syncing when she forgot to turn her microphone off during the beginning of \"My Radio (70's)\" on Dance Machine 9. Her real voice was revealed, which was not the one behind the performance of the songs. After her last official single, \"You Got Me Dancing\" in 2000, Simlat disappeared from the public eye and left the J.K. project (probably due to the proven lip-sync allegations) leaving J.K. in the void.\n"

Grindin', released in August 2014, was a remix of Lil Wayne's song that City made with Geech and GodS way. It earned him a place among Control Detroit's \"10 Detroit artists you should know in 2015.\"On January 1, 2015, City released Salmonella, his second virus (as opposed to viral) single, featuring musical artists Sino and Adubb Da Gawd. The single was included in C.O.I.N. Handlers' Loose Change vol.2. He formed the Yacht Club Social Network music collective with MCs Geechi and CEOWaun, and released their single Sanctuary in 2015.City performed at several festivals and shows in 2015, such as Hot 107.5 Summer Jamz 18 and Loose Change. He won the Imported From the D contest in May 2015 and Detroit's Local Love Tour contest for hip-hop, rap and R&B musicians in June. He had a motorcycle accident, which resulted in a recovery party and a docu-video, Road to Recovery.On December 8, 2015, he released his single Cake (a metaphor for money), which depicts a young boy fleeing his home and heading into the chaos of the streets of Detroit. Michigan Chronicle said that \"City masterfully tells a story of the desperation that comes along with trying to find opportunity in a desolate area.\"His single Addicted to mMy Ex debuted at No. 15 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart on April 19, 2016. On April 30, it hit No. 41 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, driven by surging sales (12,000 according to Nielsen Music) and streams (2.2 million U.S. clicks). The song was originally a reference for Young Thug. Its comical and \"spectacularly strange\" video follows the MC through Detroit on a quest to \"flex his ex\". It was described as \"not so much an innovative record as a biggest possible maxed-out version of contemporary sounds and trends, a record which hits much heavier than it should.\"\n"

Jeffrey's father left the family when he was very young. Atkins was raised as an only child, as his younger sister, Kristen, died in the womb when Atkins was 5. His mother, Debra, was a healthcare worker, and due to the amount of time she spent working, Atkins was largely raised by his grandparents as a Jehovah's Witness. Atkins' mother left the Jehovah's Witness religion when he was 12. Soon after, Atkins began selling drugs in Hollis.\nAfter being dropped from TVT, Ja Rule maintained a close relationship with DJ Irv, who was working as an executive producer for Def Jam at the time. DJ Irv, now known as Irv Gotti, was hired as an A&R for the label and was able to get Ja Rule a contract with Def Jam. In 1995, he made his first solo appearance on Mic Geronimo's \"Time to Build\" alongside Jay-Z and DMX, who were also in their early stages of their careers. He later appeared on the song \"Usual Suspects\" from Mic Geronimo's second album Vendetta in 1997, alongside The Lox, DMX and Tragedy Khadafi. He also had a brief cameo in the video for \"Walk In New York\" by Queens hardcore rap group Onyx. Later in 1997, Irv Gotti was granted his own imprint from Def Jam, known as Murder Inc. Records. Ja Rule was promoted as the label's flagship artist, and he continued to make guest appearances on songs by other artists, including Method Man, Redman, Nas, DMX, LL Cool J and Dru Hill. He later appeared on Jay-Z's 1998 hit single \"Can I Get A...\", for which he wrote the hook. It was originally planned to be Ja Rule's debut single until Jay-Z heard the track and requested it for himself. During this time, he rapped under the slightly modified stage name Jah.Returning to the Ja Rule name, his debut single Holla Holla was released in March 1999 and became a hit, peaking at #35 on the Billboard Hot 100. Fueled by the success of Holla Holla, Ja Rule's debut album, Venni Vetti Vecci, was released in 1999, peaking at #3 on the Billboard 200 with 184,000 copies sold in its first week. It eventually reached platinum status in the US due to the popularity of \"Holla Holla\". A remix of \"Holla Holla\" was later released, featuring Jay-Z, Vita, Cadillac Tah, Black Child, Memphis Bleek and Busta Rhymes.\nAtkins earned his GED while in prison in February 2012. In February 2021, Atkins completed an online course at Harvard Business School and shared a photo of his certificate of completion on Twitter.\nIn April 2001, Ja Rule married Aisha Murray. The couple have three children: Brittney Asja Atkins (born 1995), Jeffrey Jr. (born 2000), and Jordan (born 2003).\n"

His father was a minister at two congregations in the Greater Toronto Area. k-os moved along with his family to Trinidad while he was in grade three. In Trinidad, k-os <<<surrounded himself with music to deal with being away from Canada>>>. He returned to Canada with his mother in his teen years, taking up residence in Whitby, Ontario, a town east of Toronto, while attending Anderson Collegiate Vocational Institute. His father temporarily stayed behind in Trinidad to continue his work. His father worked as a computer engineer and became Director of Communications for BWIA, the national Trinidadian airline, while his mother owned a cosmetics company.\nGrowing up, k-os <<<was a fan of artists and groups as diverse>>> as New Order, Depeche Mode, Rx Bandits, Michael Jackson, Boogie Down Productions, Slick Rick, A Tribe Called Quest, and The Beatles. He said that he <<<was \"insecure\" in high school>>> and he <<<pursued his musical ambitions>>> because <<<after performing at an assembly in his high school gym he realized performing attracted people towards him and it made him feel \"powerful and ... secure\">>>. In 1992, he attended Carleton University in Ottawa for one semester to please his father. He returned to Toronto and enrolled into York University. <<<Being friends with>>> Nigel Williams, <<<a member of the band>>> Pocket Dwellers, Nigel encouraged k-os to <<<continue to develop his musical abilities when he was confronted with \"difficult forays\">>>.\nWhile attending York University, k-os gained his first exposure in the music industry in 1995 when he released the single \"Musical Essence\" with a music video financed by a VideoFACT grant. He dropped out of the university shortly afterwards. The single was produced with friends Clarence Gruff and Kevin Risto; currently, Risto is one half of the production duo known as Midi Mafia (produced the 50 Cent single \"21 Questions\"). After winning a MuchMusic Video Award for the single, k-os was noticed by NBA player John Salley, who became his manager. With the single gaining moderate success, k-os was invited to perform in the 1995 Hip-Hop Explosion Tour, with other Canadian acts such as Rascalz and Ghetto Concept. Salley and Raphael Saadiq began work with k-os on his planned debut Missing Links, eventually releasing his second single \"Rise Like the Sun\" in 1996. k-os suddenly withdrew from the music industry in 1996 after receiving an offer from BMG. k-os would later say that during this time he had already completed several albums but was dissatisfied with his music. He described his music as \"pretentious and derivative,\" and stated at the time that he was \"still trying to figure out who he was.\"He continued to live with his manager Salley in Los Angeles. Soon after, Red1 of the Rascalz, whom k-os befriended at the 1995 Explosion Tour, invited him to move to Vancouver, British Columbia. There he contributed a verse and chorus lines to the Rascalz' Global Warning album, released in 1999. He had also been invited to contribute to Rascalz' groundbreaking single \"Northern Touch\", but was unable to participate due to other commitments. k-os returned to the music scene by performing at the North by Northeast music festival in 1999. He took stage with the Vancouver band Namedropper.Inspired by Michael Jackson, A Tribe Called Quest, The Beatles, The Roots and Stevie Wonder, k-os worked on a new debut album. He described his new musical focus on \"doing stuff really obscure and making music for myself.\"\nHe recorded a demo tape and began looking for a record company to sign with, eventually settling on Capitol Records. Later, the parent company EMI transferred his record deal to another label, Astralwerks, co-owned by Virgin Records, after some management and scheduling issues.\nAfter the transfer k-os was added to the roster of the Toronto-based artist management firm Chris Smith Management.\n"

Ka-Spel's songwriting has been compared to that of Syd Barrett and early Pink Floyd, though the artist describes the comparison as being a coincidence, not a direct influence. Ka-Spel has cited Iannis Xenakis, The Beatles, Nurse With Wound, David Bowie, Brainticket, Can, The Residents, Magma, and Throbbing Gristle as significant influences.\n"

Kaabi-Linke was raised between Kyiv and Tunis. She moved to Dubai when she was 12 when her father took a job there. Kaabi-Linke recalled the move as difficult, particularly in losing the opportunity to study modern dance. <<<With her mother's encouragement>>>, Kaabi-Linke <<<began to draw>>>. Later she <<<studied painting at the>>> Tunis <<<Institute of Fine Arts>>>, graduated in 1999, and <<<received her Ph.D.>>> from the Sorbonne in 2008 <<<in aesthetics and the philosophy of art>>>. While in France, she met her German husband, Timo, who would later curate many of Kaabi-Linke's shows.\n\nThe artist held her first solo show in Tunis in 2009, and subsequent solo shows in Berlin (2010), the Mosaic Rooms of Earl's Court (London, 2014), and the Dallas Contemporary (2015). Kaabi-Linke received the 2009 Alexandria Biennale's Jury Prize and the 2011 Abraaj Group Art Prize. The latter commissioned her 2011 Flying Carpets, which was shown at the 54th Venice Biennale and later purchased by and exhibited at the New York Guggenheim Museum in 2016. Kaabi-Linke held a residency at the London Delfina Foundation in 2012, where she was inspired after meeting survivors of domestic violence. She won the Discoveries Prize for emerging art at the 2014 Art Basel Hong Kong, where she exhibited with the Kolkatan Experimenter gallery. One of the judges juxtaposed the social content of her work against the political reservations of other exhibitions in the show. Earlier that year, she completed her Meinstein (\"My Stone\") project in the center of Neuk\u00f6lln, a borough of Berlin. Her pavement mosaic uses stones that correspond to the national origins of the borough's residents, which is a largely immigrant population. She described her practice, at that time, as an archaeology of contemporary life. As of 2016, Kaabi-Linke is represented by Lawrie Shabibi of Dubai and Experimenter of Kolkata.\nKaabi-Linke is married and has two sons, born in early 2013 and late 2017. She lives in Berlin and Kyiv and speaks six languages.\n"

He studied under professors Marwan Kassab-Bachi and Rebecca Horn.\nKaaf is influenced by European and Arab cultures and art traditions. His abstract art is inspired by important locations in his life\u2014Damascus, Beirut, and Berlin\u2014and concepts such as Sufi mysticism and Islamic philosophy. Balance between meditation and returning to everyday life is part of the artist\u2019s thinking and is directly inscribed in his artistic activity.Kaaf\u2019s work comprises various artistic disciplines, from drawing and photography through glass sculpture, sound, and video to room installation. He primarily works with paper and ink.\nHe finds his European role models in Classical Modernism and the avant-garde of the 1960s: works like his series The Byzantine Corner were inspired by Henri Matisse\u2019s paper cutouts and the collages of the Dadaists. Influences from his delving into the German art movement ZERO are recognizable. The principle of removal and readdition is characteristic of his working method. The works display their form language in relation to point and line, surface and depth, black and white, surfaces and forms, rhythm, fire, erosion, and light and shadow. Kaaf\u2019s abstractions are the result of his intense dealings with script, architecture, and history.\nKaaf\u2019s works engage in dialogue with cultures and disciplines and, beyond them, through interdisciplinary collaborations, to Gesamtkunstwerke, syntheses of the arts. Examples include a 2018 video installation on 48 Variations for Two Pianos by John McGuire (Festival ME_MMIX 2018) in the Es Baluard Museum for Modern and Contemporary Art in Palma; in 2015, Intima, a dance project in collaboration with Dawson Dance SF and the choreographer David Dawson, San Francisco, and the composers Ashraf Kateb and Kinan Azmeh; and his recurrent collaboration since 2011 with the glassblower James Mongrain in Seattle; the products are flowing sculptural forms cooled to glass with titles like Helmet, Tattoo, and Larynx (2014), which correspond with his works on paper (Rift, Dress, Wall, and Burn Trace).\nKaaf presents his work in artist talks, lectures, and workshops, at institutions like Montana State University Billings and at the symposium on Syria and Yemen: making art today with Anna Wallace-Thompson, Buthayna Ali, Fadi Yazigi, and Kevork Mourad in the British Museum in London in 2019. The Artist in Residence Program of Germany\u2019s Foreign Ministry in cooperation with the Regional Association of Berlin Galleries, awarded to Kaaf in 2020, is the first in-house residence program of a German ministry. It is open to selected artists who come from abroad or whose work focuses intensely on the world outside Germany.\nKaaf\u2019s works are found in private and public collections all over the world, for example in the Darat Al Funun \u2013 The Khalid Shoman Foundation in Amman, in the Solidere Collection Beirut, in the MAXXI, the Italian National Museum for Art of the 21st Century (Museo nazionale delle arti del XXI secolo) in Rome, the Moontower Foundation in Bad K\u00f6nig, the Museum for Islamic Art in Berlin, and the Peter Raue collection in Berlin.\n"

            "early_life": "Kaat was the youngest of four children born to John and Nancy (Bosma) Kaat. He attended the schools of Zeeland, Michigan and is a 1956 graduate of Zeeland High School. <<<During his high school years>>>, he <<<excelled at basketball and baseball>>>.\nKaat attended Hope College in Holland, Michigan, and <<<pitched for the school's Flying Dutchmen baseball team>>>, <<<before being signed>>> by the Washington Senators <<<as an amateur free agent>>> in 1957. Kaat spent all of 1957 and 1958 in the minor leagues before breaking into the majors in 1959. After pitching in 16 games spread out over the next two seasons, Kaat became a permanent member of the pitching staff when the team moved west in 1961 to become the Minnesota Twins. On July 24, 1963 Kaat threw a complete-game shutout and hit a home run for a 5\u20130 Twins win over the Indians. Minnesota pitchers have only homered in the same game in which they threw a shutout three times, and Kaat did so twice; the second occurrence was on October 1, 1970.On July 23, 1964, he gave up two home runs to Bert Campaneris, who was making his major league debut in the game. Kaat was a member of the 1965 Twins team that won the American League pennant. He started three games in the 1965 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, matching up with Sandy Koufax on all three occasions, including a complete game victory in Game 2.\nHis best season was in 1966, when he led the league with 25 wins and 19 complete games. He finished fifth in the MVP voting and was named the American League Pitcher of the Year by The Sporting News. The National League's Sandy Koufax won the Cy Young Award by a unanimous vote; it was the last year in which only one award was given for all of Major League Baseball. Although his 1967 season was somewhat of a let down compared to 1966 (he finished 16\u201313 with a 3.04 ERA), he went on a tear in September and nearly pitched the Twins to another World Series appearance \u2014 cruising to a 7\u20130 record with a 1.51 ERA and 65 strikeouts in 652\u20443 innings pitched. However Kaat sustained a season-ending arm injury in the third inning of the second-to-last game of the season and the Boston Red Sox swept the final two games to win the American League pennant.\nIn 1974, he would set a record for largest gap between 20-win seasons at eight, a mark not surpassed until David Cone broke the mark in 1998. Kaat recorded his third 20-win season in 1975, when he pitched to a 20\u201314 record with a 3.11 ERA. This was also the only year of his career in which he received votes for the Cy Young Award, finishing fourth. Although Kaat would pitch a few games a year out of the bullpen over the course of his career, he was primarily a starting pitcher until 1979, when he became a relief pitcher in a season which he split between the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Yankees. He had been traded with Mike Buskey from the Chicago White Sox to the Phillies for Dick Ruthven, Alan Bannister and Roy Thomas on December 10, 1975. With the St. Louis Cardinals in 1982, Kaat earned his only World Series ring, working in four games out of the bullpen in the 1982 World Series.\nKaat was an All-Star three times (1962, 1966, 1975), and won the Gold Glove Award for defensive skill a record 16 consecutive times (1962\u20131977). His record for career Gold Gloves by a pitcher is now second to Greg Maddux's 18. Kaat used the same baseball glove for 15 seasons.In 1983, he became the last major league player to have played in the 1950s and the last player for the original Washington Senators to retire. Kaat is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League games in four decades. At the time of his retirement, Kaat's 25-year career was the longest of any pitcher in major league history. He is now third all-time, behind Nolan Ryan's 27 seasons and Tommy John's 26 campaigns. Kaat also set a 20th-century record by playing during the administrations of seven U.S. Presidents \u2013 Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jr., Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan. This mark was equaled by Nolan Ryan when he retired after the 1993 season, the first year of the administration of Bill Clinton.\nAs was stated during the television broadcast of the seventh game of the 1965 World Series, Kaat was a broadcaster on local radio in Minnesota. He also served as an analyst for Home Team Sports during the 1981 baseball strike. Following his stint as pitching coach, he went into sports broadcasting full-time starting out as the chief baseball correspondent for Good Morning America from 1984\u201385.His first full-time broadcasting job was with the Yankees was during the 1986 season, where he called around 100 games for WPIX. He only lasted one season as the Yankees replaced him with Billy Martin, who was between managing stints and who was purposely brought in to second-guess Lou Piniella. In between broadcasting stints for the Yankees, he spent six years (1988\u20131993) as an announcer for the Twins.In 1986, Kaat was the backup announcer for NBC Sports' coverage of baseball with Phil Stone (for the April 19 Minnesota\u2013California contest) and Jay Randolph (the July 14 Cincinnati\u2013Atlanta contest). In 1988, he covered the College World Series and the MLB playoffs and World Series for ESPN and also served as an analyst for NBC's coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics.\nKaat's marriages to his first wife, Julie, and his second wife, Linda, ended in divorce. His third wife, MaryAnn, died in July 2008 after 22 years of marriage. Kaat created a memorial fund in her name to put lights on the baseball fields in his hometown of Zeeland, Michigan, in her honor. Kaat and MaryAnn have four children and six grandchildren. Kaat married his fourth wife, Margie, in 2009.\nSee also  List of Major League Baseball players who played in four decades\nList of Major League Baseball career wins leaders\nList of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders\nList of Major League Baseball career hit batsmen leaders\nList of Major League Baseball career strikeout leaders\nList of Major League Baseball all-time leaders in home runs by pitchers\n"

In July 2015, she revealed while on the television show Non-Stop! that she was preparing to travel abroad to undergo counseling in preparation for sex reassignment surgery, as the Japanese law requires she medically transition before being allowed to have her gender legally changed, saying she may have been born a man but would like to die as a woman. In August, she appeared on a special women's only talk show promoting the release of the film Piece of Cake and announced that she would be going out of Japan to wait for her surgery. She expressed a desire to have her gender change officially recognized in front of a crowd at the National Olympic Stadium and that fellow LGBT celebrities Mitz Mangrove, Matsuko Deluxe, and Ikko were all supportive of her decision and wished her good health.

            "early_life": "Ortiz <<<has created graffiti art since at the age of ten>>>. Starting in the mid-1970s, he tagged in New York's Lower East Side under the moniker LA2. At the age of thirteen, his subway tags caught the attention of Keith Haring in 1980. Haring was reportedly inspired by Ortiz's artistry and the two began collaborating. At the age of sixteen, Ortiz was in contact with Basquiat and Andy Warhol. In 1982, Ortiz and Haring collaborated for an exhibition at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in New York.In a 1992 biography on Haring's life, Haring stated \"We just immediately hit it off. It's as if we'd known each other all our lives. He's like my little brother.\" Kenny Scharf, artist and friend of Haring's, recalled \"Keith treated him as a true collaborator; he didn't treat him like some little kid, which he actually was, really. He respected him and gave him half of whatever they collaborated on.\" Ortiz confirmed that he was paid for his work during Haring's lifetime. However, Ortiz stopped receiving payment from Haring's estate following his death. According to scholar Ricardo Montez, the Haring Foundation has \"since made strides to rectify LA2's erasure.\"Although his collaborator Haring began to be shown in galleries, Ortiz did not receive comparable success. By the early 1990s, Ortiz's contributions were largely forgotten and ignored. He became addicted to heroin and served eight months in prison for possession. Between 1987 and 2002 Ortiz was arrested at least nine times. In 2003, he was arrested for marijuana possession.In 2008, Ortiz and Clayton Patterson added black lines to a Haring mural that was re-created at the intersection of Houston and Bowery streets in order to draw attention to the erasure that Ortiz has faced from Haring's artistic career. Ortiz stated, \"when I was painting that mural, I didn't feel like it was me, I felt like it was Keith's spirit in me [...] I don't want to be rich and famous. What keeps me going is my art. I wanted to show the foundation: This is LA II, this is how it all started.\" In an interview, Ortiz relayed to The New York Sun that \"the executive director of the Haring Foundation, Julia Gruen, [has] repeatedly asked him to help authenticate Haring works in preparation for sale at auction houses such as Sotheby's while refusing his request for recognition by the foundation.\"In 2011, Ortiz was arrested three times in short succession for tagging his famed LA II and LA ROC monikers throughout the Lower East Side. Ortiz stated his graffiti spree came as a result of his wife's death, who had died earlier that year in January after a liver transplant: \"I used the street as a canvas to express myself. It's an emotional thing that I'm still going through.\" Ortiz was arrested for a third time right before the opening of his show at Dorian Grey Gallery and the show suffered as a result. At the time of his arrest, Ortiz stated \"I shouldn't have done it. I knew sooner or later I was going to get arrested.\" Friend Ramona Lugo stated, \"You know how many times I had arguments with him because he was going to do graffiti? He knew not to do that, [but] he's still got that mentality. That is the mentality of the graffiti artist.\" Ortiz was sentenced to prison at Rikers Island for 45 days for the tagging. Hearing of the sentence, Lugo added \"I'm heartbroken for him because I know he's hurting. He's going though hell in there. He doesn't belong in there. He's a good person.\" After his release, Ortiz stated \"I went there for graffiti and got transformed into a gladiator. They got all the gangs in there: the Bloods, the Latin Kings.\" Ortiz stated that the jail time gave him an opportunity to reflect and gave him new inspiration.\nIn 2020, Clayton Patterson described Ortiz as follows:LA2's struggle and history make him important to me. He was a young Puerto Rican kid who came to me for help. He had joined the Keith Haring circus at 15. Keith had the barking dog and the radiant baby. But it's graphics, not fine art. LA2 created the fill-ins. Those little symbols in Keith's work are LA2's signatures. Keith and LA2 were a collaboration, and people don't talk about their work that way. LA2 was not just the help. The art establishment has shafted him.Patterson credited the erasure of Ortiz to racism in the art world.\n"

His maternal grandfather Joseph Hanson Kwabena Nketia was a composer, professor and ethnomusicologist. M.anifest emigrated to the United States in 2001 to attend Macalester College in the twin cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul, where he graduated in 2005 with a Bachelor of Arts in economics.\nM.anifest went to high school at SOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College in Tema.

He has had artist residencies and given lectures in St. Lawrence University and the University of Ghana, and spoken to several classes in Hamline University, (his Alma mater) Macalester College, Penumbra Theater's Summer Arts Institute and Ashesi University.\nIn his time in the Twin Cities, M.anifest learnt the nitty-gritty bits of becoming an independent musician. He lent his voice to a Pepsi jingle that played nationally on U.S radio, which earned him royalties to produce and release his first solo album, Manifestations, in 2007. That album earned him the \"Songwriter of the Year\" honors in the City Pages as well as top five albums of the year recognition in the Star Tribune. In 2009 he released a free album, The Birds and the Beats, to raise awareness and funds for the work of a non-profit, Young Entrepreneurs Africa.In 2010, M.anifest linked up with Africa Express and toured France and Spain with them. He caught the attention of Africa Express co-founder Damon Albarn who thereafter invited M.anifest to be a collaborator on Rocket Juice & the Moon the following year. In September 2012, M.anifest joined the Africa Express train touring the United Kingdom. He wrote for The Huffington Post about these experiences.He released his sophomore album Immigrant Chronicles: Coming to America in September 2011, which included the singles \"Suffer\", \"Asa\" and \"Blue (Chale What Dey Happen)\". It marked a decade of his life in the U.S. and the beginning of his transition back to Ghana. In 2012, M.anifest began making major inroads in Africa performing on The Big Brother Africa stage as well at the Channel O Music Video Awards in South Africa. The video for his single \"Makaa Maka\" also got him nominated for Most Gifted Hip-Hop Video at the 2012 Channel O Music Awards and won him Best Hip-Hop Video at the locally-held 4Syte Music Video Awards.M.anifest produced and co-wrote an independence mini Hip-Hopera for Channel O and also performed a piece, at the first-ever Ghana Music Week, detailing the history of Ghanaian music.

M.anifest's god MC went on to win Hip Hop Song of the year in the Ghana Music Award the following year. Two years later on 24 December 2018, the two officially squashed their beef with Sarkodie performing at M.anifest's yearly Manifestivies concert in Accra. On June 18, 2020, the two cemented their friendship with Sarkodie featuring M.anifest on his politically conscious track, Brown Paper Bag. The song was met with mixed reaction, with popular music critic, Gabriel Myers Hansen, bemoaning its lack of dance rhythm.\"Bereft of hooks, the instrumentation of the song is crafted with chords that fend off dance; instead inducing a frightful, contemplative atmosphere complete with doomy humming and the blast of gunshots. Insofar as this facilitates the discussion it hosts, it is fit for purpose. After all, this is not a forum for the fainthearted.\"\n"

In 1985, Ma <<<graduated from a local polytechnic college>>> and <<<entered the municipal water works department>>>, where he <<<worked as a technician in charge of furnace maintenance>>>. He <<<later began taking on administrative roles>>>. In 1997, Ma was named head of the water works division of Beidaihe, a seaside resort popular with leaders of the Communist Party. In 2005, the municipal water works was re-organized into a corporation, which signed a 25-year contract with the city to maintain the water supply. Ma became its vice president in charge of its Beidaihe branch.In November 2010, the operations of the Beidaihe branch of the company was separated from that of Qinhuangdao. In the next year, the state-owned Beidaihe Water Works Corporation was founded with Ma Chaoqun as its chief executive. The company served Beidaihe as well as neighbouring counties. More importantly, the company was charged with providing water to various state and party agencies stationed in the area, including to Communist leaders during their annual summer retreat in Beidaihe. In 2012, Ma was given recognition by the province for his high performance during the summer months, named a \"Model Labourer\" by the city of Qinhuangdao.In January 2014, Ma was reported by people with links to a state-owned company in Beijing as having solicited bribes worth millions of yuan from a local hotel. On February 12, 2014, Ma was detained for a corruption investigation.  His younger brother Ma Zhongqun was detained on the same day, and his younger sister Ma Qingru was arrested a month later. On November 12, 2014, the Hebei provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection (CDI) released findings of its investigation, accusing Ma of embezzlement, bribery, and illegally moving public resources. He was arrested and faced a raft of criminal charges.The Ma case gained notoriety for the astronomical value of alleged bribes.  The Hebei CDI was said to have discovered over 120 million yuan ($19.3 million) worth of cash in Ma's home. Also unearthed was 37 kilograms of gold and 68 real estate certificates of ownership. To carry out Ma's arrest, the police mobilized the city's special operations unit, as Ma was believed to have ties with local organized crime. That Ma, merely a division-level (\u5904\u7ea7) official (i.e., rank equivalent to that of a county governor) had such a large sum stored up in his home shocked the public. Ma's mother Zhang Guiying denied that her son was corrupt, claiming that the assets were the result of years of hard work by her husband who operated a coal mine, asserting that her son was being blackmailed.Chinese media has also reported connections between Ma Chaoqun and his so-called \"godfather\", who was suspected to be a high-level official from Beijing. It has been suggested that the processing of the case has faced interference from the authorities as increasing its scope may have dragged out an 'untouchable tiger'.Ma is married to Zhang Lihuan. They had one son. Ma's name, \"Chaoqun\", means \"soars above the rest.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n"

            "early_life": "Ma was born in Bangkok to a Thai Chinese father and a Hong Kong Teochew mother. He has one younger sister. Ma first attended NIST International School, but at the age of 8, his family moved to Hong Kong, where he resumed studying in Quarry Bay School. He then excelled 2 years past his usual studying year group and attended South Island School of Hong Kong. In late 2011, he was discovered by Supachai Srivijit, who then became his manager in the entertainment industry, and Ma returned to Thailand to study in Harrow International School, Bangkok. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree of Arts in Business English and a master\u2019s degree  of Business Administration in Tourism and Hospitality Management from Assumption University. Before Ma decided to be an actor, he thought about being a pro golfer. He won a gold medal in the ISSFHK Golf Pairs Championship 2008 in Hong Kong and many other awards against other schools. In 2008, he <<<auditioned for>>> The Star (season 7), <<<a>>> Thai <<<reality show and singing competition>>>, but didn't pass through the final audition.\nMa made his acting debut at the age of 20 with a lead role in a special period drama Gentlemen of Jutathep Series in 2013. This special series made to celebrate ThaiTV3's 43rd anniversary, which assigned five top producers to each make a period drama about the five Jutathep brothers: Khun Chai Taratorn, Khun Chai Pawornruj, Khun Chai Phuttipat, Khun Chai Rachanon and Khun Chai Ronapee. His main series which is Khun Chai Ronapee is directed by Chatchai Plengpanich and he was acted with Chalida Vijitvongthong as female lead. This period drama is an adaptation from the novel of the same name. Before the drama aired, Ma was harshly criticized by netizen, saying that he lacked the looks and talent but he proved to everyone his talent when the drama aired.\nMa then starred in the short film titled Thai Niyom: Prince Pom in 2014. He plays as Prince Pom. This was his first performance in short film after debuting. On the same year, Ma participated in Give Me 5 Concert alongside Mario Maurer, Sukollawat Kanarot, Nadech Kugimiya and Phupoom Pongpanu. During his concert, he invited Tata Young and Boy Peacemaker as his special guest.\nIn 2015, Ma returned to TV screens, after a two-year absence, with a romance action drama The King's Servant directed by Atthaporn Teemakorn. This story takes place in the era of Rama III, the third king of Siam under the House of Chakri. The story sets around the period when Britain (known as Wilat at that time) enters into a commercial partnership role with Siam. He was paired opposite Peranee Kongthai in the series.In the same year, Ma was cast as a lead role in Just a Man, Not a Magician with Kimberley Anne Woltemas. This drama is a remake of 2001 Samee Ngern Phon, and was produced by Ann Thongprasom and directed by Kritsada Techanilobon.\nIn late 2015, Ma made his movie debut as a lead role alongside South Korean actress Hahm Eun-jung in a sci-fi romance movie Microlove. This movie was directed by Sathanapong Limwongthong. It revolves around an outgoing and wealthy Thai man, who works in a Korean software company that privately develops a software and catches the interest of the president\u2019s daughter.\n"

            "early_life": "Ma was born in Beijing China, in 1973. After moving from Beijing to Oklahoma, Ma <<<started drawing and painting as an alternative to literature>>>, from which she felt alienated having to speak a second language. Ma <<<received a Bachelor of Arts degree in advertising design>>> from Oklahoma Christian University of Science and Arts. In 1999, she <<<earned a Master of Fine Arts degree>>> at Pratt Institute in New York.\nPost graduation, she worked for eight years as the studio director for artist Cai Guo-Qiang.\nMa's initial practical training in advertising fostered in her \"a production and design aesthetic \u2026 in the sense that she is responsive to the qualities and needs of materials as well as to the demands of place and public,\" while remaining critical of market and client. In 2001, Ma fought with another female Asian artist/designer in the live-wrestling performance Crouching Bitch at Deitch Projects. The combat signified the competition between Ma's own short-lived Dodorama fashion label and her co-combatant's, mocking the concurrent New York Fashion Week where downtown designers rivaled to be the \"best.\"The iconoclastic dimension of Crouching Bitch continued in installations such as Wash Hands, made in Beijing in 2003, and Project Change World: City of Yan'an in 2006, but within a more social and political context. In Wash Hands, formally conforming to the government-led hygiene campaign against SARS, Ma instigated unease by asking viewers to wash hands in the same bowl of water. Seemingly in honor of the once politically significant city Yan'an, Project Change World: City of Yan'an was a public service program to highlight, poke fun, and instigate into the universally mocked Chinglish.Ma continued to deal with social consciousness and psychology. In Self-Comfort, a 2005 installation, a video of a woman masturbating was projected onto an actual bed, presenting a self-guided release from loneliness and tension in daily life. The conventionally ignoble act obtained an ambiguous meaning by reflecting the universal loneliness in society.\nSubsequent works stay highly aware of people's ways of living, with more focus on the spiritual life. The video installation Alms was part of the Singapore Biennale in 2006. The video trilogy was set in three religious sites of distinct beliefs. It featured a hand clasping, revealing and finally losing glass balls. The sound track was composed out of recordings of vocal and instrumental sounds of worship at each site. The project underscored the Biennial's theme of \"Belief\" by drawing connections between sites of three distinctive religions, namely Judaism, Islam and Christianity. More fundamentally, the glass balls symbolized the balance that is being constantly negotiated in spiritual life.Alms is the continuation of Ma's reflection upon religious life since Aeolian Garden at UMOCA in 2005, a work consisting of brass windpipes installed under the medieval bridge of San Francesco in the Tuscan town of Colle di Val d'Elsa, creating an atmospheric soundscape. The bridge, initially built to lead people from daily life to religious refuge, \"can once again serve as a conduit for contemplation and reflection.\" The work remains part of the town's cultural patrimony.\nWhile Alms and Aeolian Garden do call for the coexistence of religions and the peace of mind, the idea of dissonance is another running theme of Ma's early works. The dissonance within social life is subtly allegorized by the use of sound. For the short video Rear Window, Ma documented the nightlife of people living in a large residential complex across the street from her apartment. The video is accompanied by sound tracks composed from the artist's own imagination, which makes the much-desired intimacy a mere projection of one's own psyche. Communication seems unachievable despite the voyeuristic observation. The dissonance continues in the soundscapes created by Aeolian Garden. Mario Cristinati observes that, \"The music \u2026 may be harmonious or dissonant, depending on the particular wind conditions \u2026 It also demonstrates how nature intervenes with our senses \u2026 similar to how spiritual life and daily life collide.\" The soundtrack for Alms combined from sound recorded at three religious sites, is also at times cacophonous, revealing a critical attitude toward tolerance and unity.\n"

            "early_life": "Ma was born in Qingdao, a city in Shandong Province on China's Yellow Sea coast, on 18 August 1953. As a child, he was the pupil of a painter who had been persecuted as a Rightist. After his school education was cut short by the Cultural Revolution, he <<<studied by himself>>>, <<<copying out a Chinese dictionary word by word>>>. At fifteen, he joined a propaganda arts troupe, and was later assigned a job as a watchmender's apprentice. For a few years he worked in a petrochemical plant near Beijing, then in 1979, moved to the capital and became a photojournalist for a magazine published by the All China Federation of Trade Unions. During this time, he <<<joined>>> the 'underground' No Name art group, <<<the>>> Yuanmingyuan <<<poetry group>>>, and the April photographers' group. He held clandestine exhibitions of his paintings in his one-room shack in Nanxiao Lane, which became a meeting point for dissident artists and writers of Beijing. \nIn 1983, his paintings were denounced during the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign, and he was placed in detention. After his release, he resigned from his job and set off on a three-year journey through China, selling his paintings and stories as he went. When he returned to Beijing in 1986, he wrote Stick Out Your Tongue, a novella inspired by his travels through Tibet. Its publication in the official journal People's Literature in February 1987 coincided with a nationwide crackdown on the arts, and the government publicly denounced the work as an example of bourgeois liberalism. All copies of the journal were confiscated and destroyed, and a blanket ban was placed on the future publications of Ma Jian's books.\nJust before this event, Ma Jian had moved to Hong Kong, where speech freedoms are much higher. He wrote Bardo, a novel about two doomed lovers who are reincarnated through Chinese history, and The Nine Crossroads, about a group of sent-down youth who are sent to a remote mountain inhabited by a primitive tribe.\nIn 1989, Ma Jian returned to Beijing and took part in the democracy protests. After the Tiananmen massacre, he remained in the capital and wrote The Noodle Maker, a dark political satire. For the next few years, he travelled back and forth between Hong Kong and China, editing, briefly, the Hong Kong arts magazine, Wen Yi Bao, and setting up the New Era publishing company and the literary journal Trends, which published essays and novels banned in China.\nAfter the Handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, Ma Jian moved to Germany to take up a post teaching Chinese literature at Ruhr University, and to work on Beijing Coma, a novel about the Tiananmen massacre and the decade of political repression and economic growth that followed it. In 1999, he moved to London and wrote Red Dust, a fictionalised account of his journey through China in the 1980s, which won the 2002 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award. He returned to China regularly, and resumed work on Beijing Coma, which was finally published in 2008 and won the 2009 Index on Censorship T.R. Fyvel Book Award and the 2010 Athens Prize for Literature. In 2008\u20132009, he travelled extensively through the remote interior of China to research The Dark Road, a novel that explores the One Child Policy, published by Chatto & Windus and Penguin in 2013.\nIn 2001, he collaborated in founding the Independent Chinese PEN Centre, a branch of PEN International, became its board member in 2003\u20132005 and 2009\u20132011, a member of its Freedom to Write Committee since 2003, and director of its Press & Translation Committee since 2011.\nMa Jian is a vocal critic of China's Communist government. His works explore themes and subjects that are taboo in China. He has continually called for greater freedom of expression and the release of jailed writers and other political prisoners. As a result, his books have been banned in China for the last 25 years, and since the summer of 2011, he has been denied entry into China. Despite the restrictions placed on him, Ma Jian has become a leading Chinese writer, internationally distinguished with his works translated into a great number of languages, including English, French, Spanish, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Catalan, Japanese, Dutch, Hebrew, Romanian, Turkish, Greek, Polish, Korean, Italian and Portuguese.\nIn April 2012, while attending the London Book Fair, Ma used red paint to smear a cross over his face and a copy of his banned book Beijing Coma and called his Chinese publisher a \"mouthpiece of the Chinese communist party\" after being \"manhandled\" while attempting to present the book to the director of the General Administration of Press and Publication and the director of National Copyright Administration, Liu Binjie, at the fair.In November 2018, Ma was a guest at the Hong Kong International Literary Festival. Tai Kwun, the venue for the events, initially cancelled his two talks, because it did not want to \"become a platform to promote the political interests of any individual\", but subsequently reversed course. The incident sparked public outcry in Hong Kong. Many related this with the recent Victor Mallet visa controversy and the cancellation of Badiucao's exhibition, complaining that China was covertly silencing critics in the autonomous territory and curbing her autonomy.He lives in London with his partner and translator, Flora Drew, and their four children.\n"
