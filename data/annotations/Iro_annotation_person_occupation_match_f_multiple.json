He is a 32nd-generation descendant of his Hakka clan, which can be traced back to the 10th century.Ho attended Queen's College Hong Kong from 1975 to 1979, after which he went to the United Kingdom, where he enrolled at Chelmer Institute of Higher Education and obtained his <<<bachelor of laws degree>>> in 1984. Ho joined a post-graduate programme at the University of Hong Kong in 1984 and obtained his mandatory practising qualification, the <<<postgraduate certificate in laws (PCLL)>>> in 1986.\nAfter gaining his qualifications he was admitted as a solicitor in Hong Kong in 1988 and similarly admitted in Singapore, and England and Wales in 1995 and 1997. He is the senior partner of a law firm in Hong Kong and a principal representative of a law firm in Guangzhou.  His major <<<practice field is civil litigation, specialising in shareholders' disputes and family disputes>>>. He was appointed a China-Appointed Attesting Officer in 2003.He became the vice-president of the Law Society of Hong Kong in June 2005 and was elected president for a one-year term in May 2011, after which he has served as a council member.In 2017, his legal qualifications in England and Wales, and Singapore was disputed, and the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) was contacted regarding this matter. It was reported that the individual by the name of \"Junius Kwan-Yiu Ho\" does not appear to be on the SRA's records.  The dispute, however, was later clarified, for a member by the name of \"Kwan Yiu Ho\" does appear to be on SRA's records.\nHo first contested a Legislative Council election in 2008, running against Civic Party's Margaret Ng in the Legal functional constituency. He was defeated, receiving 1,286 votes, about 34 percent of the vote.Ho was elected as Chairman of Tuen Mun Rural Committee in 2011, ousting the long-time chairman and most powerful rural leader Lau Wong-fat, chairman of the Heung Yee Kuk. In that capacity, he became an ex officio member of the Tuen Mun District Council. He served as the rural committee chairman until 2015.  He was a candidate in the Legislative Council election in New Territories West in September 2012, where he received 10,805 votes, about two per cent of total vote share and was not elected.Ho was appointed to Lingnan University council by Chief Executive of Hong Kong Leung Chun-ying in October 2015. Students staged a protest against the appointment over fears of political interference in university governance.In the 2015 District Council elections, Junius Ho defeated Albert Ho of the Democratic Party in the latter's long-held Lok Tsui seat in a six-way contest by a narrow margin of 277 votes, as the pro-democracy votes were split between Albert Ho and Cheng Chung-tai of Civic Passion. Ho ran again in the 2016 Legislative Council election for the New Territories West. During the election, Ho's supporters were allegedly involved in the withdrawal of candidacy of Liberal Party candidate Ken Chow Wing-kan.  Chow claimed he had been intimidated after receiving threats made against him. On the following day, Ho identified that some of the threats were made by one of his volunteers that had helped him for about one or two months; but Ho defended him by stating that the volunteer only wanted to be angry for him. Ho was elected with 35,657 votes, winning the last of nine seats in the constituency.\nIn May 2017, pro-democracy lawyer Kevin Yam published an article urging solicitors not to vote for Junius Ho in the election for the governing council of the Law Society of Hong Kong. Ho sued for defamation but failed to be re-elected, securing only 572 of 8,148 votes, coming last. In the 2019 District Council elections, Ho with 2,626 votes lost his seat to his rival Lo Chun-yu who had 1,213 more votes.In December 2021, Hong Kong Free Press reported that Ho's voting power in the 2021 Hong Kong legislative election was approximately 7,215 times more than that of an ordinary citizen, as he was a member of the Election Committee and thus could vote for the 40 Legislative Council members elected by the Election Committee constituency; an individual voter in the Heung Yee Kuk functional constituency; a representative of Ho K.C. & Fong Solicitors & Notaries which was a corporate voter in the Commercial (First) functional constituency; as well as being a regular voter in his geographical constituency, New Territories North.\nHe owns two horses, Alex Flyer (\u5929\u797f) and Hong Kong Bet (\u9752\u5c71\u4e4b\u5bf6) that race at The Hong Kong Jockey Club. The graves of Ho's parents were vandalized during the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests, which is believed to be due to his \nassociation with the Yuen Long attacks, though the identity of the perpetrators remains unknown.On 31 August 2022, Ho tested positive for COVID-19.\n"

With the paper ballots included, Ho slightly surpassed Fung in the final vote tally, securing a place for ADPL in the general election.On 6 January 2021, Ho was among 53 members of the pro-democratic camp who were arrested under the national security law, specifically its provision regarding alleged subversion. The group stood accused of the organisation of and participation in unofficial primary elections held by the camp in July 2020. Ho was released on bail on 7 January.After he was charged with subversion, together with 47 others, Ho decided to resign as vice-chairman of ADPL on 17 March 2021, and he was replaced by Howard Lee. On 10 July, Ho decided to resign from his position as a councillor of Sham Shui Po District Council on 10 July 2021, citing imminent removal from office under a massive disqualification from the government based on violation of both the Basic Law and the national security law.\n\n\n== References ==\n"

He was educated in Thailand, Taiwan, the US and Singapore. He went on to Tunghai University in Taiwan where the exposure to Chinese culture left a deep impact on him. After a year in Taiwan, he left for Stanford University in the US. After returning to Singapore, he did his national service as a combat engineer. He later studied at the National University of Singapore, where <<<he graduated in economics and history>>> with a silver medal awarded by the Singapore Employers' Federation for being the second most outstanding student in the final year examination.\nPresently, Ho Kwon Ping is the Founder and Executive Chairman of Banyan Tree Holdings and Laguna Resorts and Hotels, and Executive Chairman of Thai Wah Public Company.

Many years later, in 2018, Ho shared in a candid dialogue session about Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding prime minister, for detaining him. His detainment ironically boosted his academic grades as he was \"so happy\" to gain access to books that \"he studied for 18 hours a day and topped the entire faculty in the examinations\".After Ho's release, he continued to work as a journalist, settling on Banyan Tree Bay in Hong Kong with his wife for three years. Ho's foray into the business world came several years later when he decided to join the family business after his father suffered a stroke.

She told reporters after inauguration ceremony that smuggling lobsters from Hong Kong to China will undermine Chinese trade restrictions against Australia, and endanger the national security, hence the customs has intensified the crackdown on so. As the Chinese Government has been claiming the ban on Australian lobsters was over fears of elevated traces of minerals and metals since October 2020, comments from Ho were the first official remarks that suggest the targeting of Australian lobsters was motivated by political interests, not health or contamination fears. Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan, as a result, asked Beijing whether Australia was economically sanctioned. Ho later insisted food security is part of national security, argued that her comments were misinterpreted and the authorities will not tolerate so.\nLouise Ho, who was Assistant Superintendent in Customs Department at that time, met Chief Immigration Officer Erick Tsang at work. The duo got married while Tsang was in posting at Office of the Hong Kong Government in Beijing, and finally registered their marriage in 2007. Tsang and Ho did not go on honeymoon, and had no children because of work.

Ho was raised in Thailand, near Bangkok, enrolled in Tunghai University in Taiwan and subsequently transferred to Cornell University in the United States, where she received her bachelor's degree in economics.\nIt was at Cornell that she <<<first began to write, as a way to combat homesickness>>>. She submitted a short story, titled Sing to the Dawn, to the Council for Interracial Books for Children for its annual short story contest. She won the award for the Asian American Division of unpublished Third World Authors, and was encouraged to expand the story into a novel.\nThis she did, and through the process Ho <<<began to see writing as \"a political expression>>>,\" as she once wrote in Interracial Books for Children Bulletin. She had mistrusted the stories about Thailand, Burma, and China she previously read, for she thought that their mostly idyllic portrayal of lives there misrepresented the Asia that she came to know during her childhood. In Sing to the Dawn, Ho brought her readers into a realistic rural Thailand through the eyes of a young village girl Dawan, whose struggle to convince those around her to allow her to take up a scholarship to study in the city reflected the gender discrimination faced by girls in rural Thailand.\nAfter graduating from Cornell University in 1973, Ho returned to Asia and began working as a journalist for The Straits Times in Singapore. She left two years later for Chiang Mai University in Thailand, where she taught English. The three years she spent in Chiang Mai had a deep impact on her. Together with her students and colleagues, Ho spent several periods living and working in nearby villages, as part of the ongoing student movement to alleviate rural poverty. While the student leaders were preoccupied with organizing the peasants into a political group in their search for democracy, Ho became more aware of the emotional world of the women and children there.\nHowever, on October 6, 1976, Ho witnessed the massacre of student protesters in a military coup d'\u00e9tat which restored military rule in the kingdom. But she did not stay long under such circumstance. After marrying John Value Dennis, Jr., an international agriculture policy person whom she met during her Cornell years, Ho left for her alma mater again, where she completed a Master's course in creative writing while working as an English literature teaching assistant. She had also spent some time in relief work along the Thai-Cambodian border in 1980.\nIn 1986, Ho gave birth to her first child, a son. And finally, a decade after returning from Thailand, she began writing fiction again. The result was Rice without Rain, a story centering on Jinda, a seventeen-year-old girl from the fictitious Maekung Village which was caught up in the political winds sweeping across the country when a group of university students from Bangkok arrived to encourage the landless farmers to take up a rent resistance movement. Set against the very same historical background as Ho had experienced herself, Jinda's realization that the peasant class was but pawns in the ongoing political tug-of-war and her journey to find her own path in life told the untold stories during those years of turmoil that shrouded Thailand.\nFive years later Ho published her third book, The Clay Marble. This time she drew her inspiration from the interaction with Cambodian refugees during her relief work on the Thai-Cambodian border. Once again, she presented a strong female protagonist, a twelve-year-old girl named Dara who was one of the thousands of refugees escaping to the border at the end of the Khmer Rouge regime when Vietnam invaded the country. She also employed the theme of family unity in the face of adversity, as Dara persuaded her elder brother not to join the army but to return with family, sans their father, to restart life back at home.\nIn 1983, Ho returned to Singapore, where she worked as the writer-in-residence at the National University of Singapore for the next seven years. As a result, she is widely referred to there as a \"local writer\". Her works have been selected as teaching material for English literature in lower secondary schools. Since 1990, Ho has been living with her family in Ithaca, New York. She has also traveled and made presentations at various writing workshops in middle schools and high schools in the United States and international schools in Switzerland, Indonesia, Thailand, Poland, and Malaysia.\nAfter the birth of her third and last child Ho shifted her focus to writing books for children. Collaborating with Saphan Ros, executive director of the Cambodian Association of Greater Philadelphia, she published two books on traditional Cambodian folktales, The Two Brothers and Brother Rabbit: A Cambodian Tale. In the meantime, she even translated sixteen Tang poems into English and compiled them into a picture book titled Maples in the Mist: Children's Poems from the Tang Dynasty. In 2004, she returned to writing for more mature readers with Gathering the Dew, a story of how a young Cambodian girl who lost her sister during the Khmer Rouge regime learnt to reconcile with life's harsh realities and live on.\n"

Later, at age 26, she <<<launched her own public relations firm>>>. She also supported her sister Josie Ho's efforts to establish her own singing career in the early 1990s over the objection of their father.Ho owns 29% of the MGM Grand Macau, <<<an association which has proven controversial for business partner>>> MGM Mirage. Nevada's Gaming Control Board and Gaming Commission held extensive hearings in March 2007 on the matter of MGM's partnership with Ho, after which they found that she was a suitable business partner. However, in March 2010, she was barred from running a gaming business in New Jersey due to state gaming regulators' conclusion, based on Cap 148 Gambling Ordinance (kui yau yat tiu gui lun), that her father has \"extensive ties\" to organised crime, and MGM Mirage was ordered to \"disengage itself from any business association\" with her.After the passing of her father on 26 May 2020, she is expected to consolidate control under the Sociedade de Jogos de Macau umbrella.\nHo married Julian Hui, son of shipping magnate Hui Sai-fun, in 1991. They divorced in 2000. Late in their marriage, both began seeking other relationships; Ho entered into a relationship with Gilbert Yeung, the son of her father's hospitality and entertainment industry competitor, Albert Yeung. However, Gilbert Yeung's arrest for drug possession in August 2000 at Ho's birthday party focused unwanted media attention on Ho and her relationship with him; Ho's father also made comments in interviews threatening to disown her if she married him. This led to the end of Ho's relationship with Yeung, and also the public announcement that she and Hui would be seeking a divorce.Ho's ties to Chinese organised crime have also been reported by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, citing a U.S. Senate committee and several government agencies, when the state investigated her ties to American casino operator MGM Mirage. Ho's father, Stanley Ho, was also named by the Canadian Government, citing the Manila Standard newspaper, as having a link to the Kung Lok Triad (Chinese mafia) and as being linked to \"several illegal activities\" during the period 1999\u20132002.\nIn 2018, she spent HK$900 million on a property in one of Hong Kong's most exclusive neighbourhoods, The Peak, then Asia's second-highest price for a residential property.In Aug 2020, Ho lodged a caveat over her father\u2019s estate at the Probate Registry in Hong Kong after her sister and cousin to register an interest in the handling of her father's will.\n\n\n== References ==\n"

Together with other students, he was expelled in 1988 for protesting about the lack of investigation into the death of another student.\nFollowing involvement with protests, Htein Lin, together with other activists, withdrew to camps on the border with India. Here he became a member of the All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF), opposed to the Burmese military regime.  During this period, he <<<studied with the artist>>> Sitt Nyein Aye from Mandalay, <<<learning about western artists>>> such as Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. He used his skills to add illustrations the publications of the ABSDF. He was involved with internal conflicts within the ABSDF in 1991 and was imprisoned. In 1993, Htein Lin continued his law degree, which he completed in 1994.\nInstead of working in the legal profession, Htein Lin became an artist and also an actor in comic films (as \"Htein Htein\") in the mid 1990s. He led the way with modern Burmese performance art. His artistic performances included The Little Worm in the Ear, in Yangon, and Guitarist in 1996.\nHtein Lin spent 6\u00bd years as a political prisoner in Burma from 1998-2004. He continued to perform for fellow inmates in prison. Officially, he was not permitted to <<<paint while imprisoned>>>. However, he  managed to produce several hundred paintings secretly, using white cotton prison uniforms, as well as about a thousand drawings. He bribed the prison guards to smuggle paint to him, but it was too dangerous to have a paintbrush in his cell. Instead, he used various objects that were available to him, including cigarette lighters, pieces of glass, plates, nets, razor blades, syringes, or simply his fingers and hands. He used a monoprint technique.\nAfter his release from prison in 2004, he returned to art and performance. His May 2005 Rangoon street performance entitled Mobile Art Gallery/Mobile Market meant he was interrogated by the authorities again.\nHe was introduced in 2005 to the British Ambassador in Yangon, Vicky Bowman, who took receipt of his prison paintings and ensured their preservation by loaning them to  the Burma Archives Project at the International Institute of Social History  in Amsterdam. He later married Bowman and they moved to live in London for seven years.\nDuring his time in the UK, Htein Lin undertook performance art in Trafalgar Square, central London, on 1 June 2008.He also had exhibitions and performed in Finland, France, Norway, Thailand, Czech Republic and the United States of America. In addition, he has performed at the 2007 Venice Biennale and at festivals in Finland, Japan, Malaysia, and the Philippines. His performances draw on his artistic life as well as aiming to raise awareness of the Burmese political situation.\nHtein Lin has continued to use the monoprint technique in his subsequent paintings. These draw on his Theravada Buddhist faith, Burmese symbols and traditions, his early experience as a comedian in \"anyeint\" satirical performances, and events such as Cyclone Nargis and the Saffron Revolution.\nIn 2013, Htein Lin returned to live in Rangoon, and commenced his project A Show of Hands Project. In 2014 he returned one week in prison to train prisoners to Vipassana meditation and monoprint painting techniques  In November 2015, Htein Lin campaigned in the delta area for the National League for Democracy of Aung San Suu Kyi  and his native township Ingapu.\nIn the aftermath of the 2021 Myanmar coup d'\u00e9tat, he was reportedly detained in Yangon on 24 August 2022, along with his wife Vicky Bowman, and charged with immigration offences. PEN America called for his immediate release. He was released in November 2022, as part of a mass pardon to mark National Day.\nHe is married to the former British Ambassador to Myanmar, Vicky Bowman, and they have one daughter.\n"

She then pursued her graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley. Under the mentorship of Corey S. Goodman, Hu <<<explored the role of the plexin receptor>>> and the Rho family GTPases in central nervous system development in Drosophila. Plexins are receptors involved in axon guidance, and Hu discovered a seven amino acid sequence in plexin, PlexB, which is necessary for Rac-GTP binding and subsequently axon guidance. Interestingly, PlexB inhibits Rac from binding downstream interactors while at the same time enhancing RhoA activity, altogether driving axon guidance. In further work, Hu found that CrossGAP, a GTPase-activating protein, is responsible for regulating Rac dependent-cytoskeletal changes during axon guidance in Drosophila. Hu completed her PhD in 2002.Following her PhD, Hu pursued her postdoctoral work under the mentorship of Julius Zhu and Roberto Malinow at the University of Virginia. In 2004, Hu moved to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and then to the University of California, San Diego in 2006, to continue working under the mentorship of Malinow. During her postdoc, Hu explored the role of AMPA receptor trafficking in emotional enhancement of memory formation as well as the role of Ras GTPase signalling in fragile X syndrome.\nIn 2008, Hu returned to China and <<<joined the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai and became the principal investigator of the Hu Lab>>>. Her lab has been focusing on the neural mechanisms of social dominance in mice as well as the neural mechanisms of depression and the antidepressant effects of ketamine.

            "early_life": "Hu Jintao was born on 21 December 1942 in Tai County, Jiangsu province, which was under Japanese occupation at the time. He is a direct descendant of the Ming dynasty general Hu Zongxian, known for fighting Japanese pirates. His branch of the family migrated from Jixi County, Anhui to Taizhou during his grandfather's generation. Though his father owned a small tea trading business in Taizhou, the family was relatively poor. His mother was a teacher and died when he was 7, and he was raised by an aunt. Hu's father was denounced during the Cultural Revolution, an event that (together with his relatively humble origins) apparently had a deep effect upon Hu, who diligently tried to clear his father's name.He joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in April 1964. That year he graduated from Tsinghua University after studying hub hydropower stations at the Water Conservancy Engineering Department. He <<<began working>>> in July 1965 as an engineer.In 1968, during the Third Front construction,:\u200a179\u200a Hu volunteered for his service in Gansu and worked on the construction of Liujiaxia Hydroelectric Station while also managing CCP affairs for the local branch of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power. From 1969 to 1974, he worked for Sinohydro Engineering Bureau.Hu is married to Liu Yongqing, whom he met at Tsinghua University when they were studying there. They have two children together, Hu Haifeng and Hu Haiqing. Unlike Wen Jiabao, the premier, he never granted a public one-on-one interview with the media.\nHe has been noted for his liking of table tennis and ballroom dancing.\nHu is also said to possess a photographic memory that became evident in his high school days.\nIn 1973, Hu was transferred to the Construction Department of Gansu as a secretary. The next year he was promoted to deputy senior party secretary. In 1980, Deng Xiaoping implemented the \"Four Transformations\" program, which aimed to produce communist leaders who were \"more revolutionary, younger, more knowledgeable, and more specialized.\" In response to this nationwide search for young party members, Song Ping, the first secretary of CCP Gansu Committee (Gansu's governor) discovered Hu Jintao and promoted him several ranks to the position of deputy head of the commission. Another prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Song, Wen Jiabao, also became prominent at the same time.\nIn 1982, Hu was promoted to the position of Communist Youth League Gansu Branch secretary and was appointed as the director of the All-China Youth Federation. His mentor, Song Ping, was transferred to Beijing as Minister of Organization of the Chinese Communist Party, and was in charge of senior cadres' recommendation, candidacy and promotion. With the support of Hu Yaobang (no relation) and Deng Xiaoping, Hu was assured of a bright future in the party. At Song Ping's suggestion, in 1982 central CCP authorities invited Hu to Beijing to study at the Central Party School. Soon after, he was transferred to Beijing and appointed to a position in the secretariat of the Communist Youth League Central Committee (\"CY Central\"). Two years later Hu was promoted to first secretary of CY Central, thus its actual leader. During his term in the Youth League, Hu escorted Hu Yaobang, who was CCP general secretary then, in visits around the country. Hu Yaobang, himself a veteran coming from the Youth League, could reminiscence his youth through Hu's company.\n"

His parents had travelled to England in 1936, where his father was an inventor and engineer who created the Ifield fuel pump, for Lucas Industries, which was used in jet aircraft.The Ifield family returned to Australia in January 1948 aboard the Orion.

He was given a guitar in 1949 by his grandmother and was self-taught; he also taught himself to yodel, by imitating country stars, including Hank Snow.The family moved to Beecroft, a Sydney suburb. At the age of 13 he performed his version of Bill Showmet's \"Did You See My Daddy Over There?\" and appeared on local radio station 2GB's talent quest, Amateur Hour. This track was issued as his first single, in 1953, by Regal Zonophone Records. By November of that year he appeared regularly on Brisbane radio station, 4BK's Youth Parade, playing guitar and singing, where, \"All the artists in this programme are under 21 year of age.\"His third single was a cover version of \"Abdul Abulbul Amir\" (September 1954), which was backed by his own composition, \"A Mother's Faith\".

The short story is set in Tsuki-j\u014d shrine. He had previously submitted the manga to the sh\u014djo manga magazine LaLa, but the magazine's editors rejected it due to its lack of romance in the story and advised Igarashi to submit it to a seinen manga magazine. \"Ohayashi ga kikoeru hi\" became the first chapter of the series Hanashippanashi, consisting of different short stories. He focused on a series consisting of short stories in order to still experiment with styles and themes in the beginning of his career. Hanashippanashi was serialized in Afternoon until 1996.

Igarashi had an interest in becoming a carpenter and later to be an artist. As a teenager, he would explore the nearby Komine Castle with a camcorder. His first experience with video games was Atari's tennis game Pong at age 10, and an arcade game Crazy Climber two years later led him to want to design games. He taught himself the computer program languages BASIC and assembly language, and designed amateur games. While attending university, he received a job offer from the company Grafika, which he had to turn down as he did not wish to work there. He accepted the next job offer, which was at Konami.\n"

Winner of the Grand Prix second place, Igarashi joined the group shortly after, along with first placer Yuichi Nakamura and third placer Katsuki Nakamura.In early 2006, Igarashi conquered his first lead role as Mirai Hibino/Ultraman Mebius in the tokusatsu series Ultraman Mebius, the 40th anniversary production in the Ultraman series. He was chosen for the role for being able to convey the part of a \"rookie\" hero well, being at the time a new actor with little experience in demanding lead roles himself. A fan of the Ultraman series, Igarashi has declared that the desire to play the role of Ultraman was one of the reasons he entered the entertainment world, and that being able to work with the same actors who had played his childhood heroes was one of his highest personal accomplishments. Igarashi was so fond of his work in the series that he eventually incorporated the M\u00f6bius strip sign \"\u221e\" to his autograph.\nWith the end of Mebius in March 2007, Igarashi turned his focus to television series and invested on broadening his work. The heroic Mirai of Mebius was followed by diverse characters such as the young psychopath Otoya in the adult drama Watashitachi no Kyokasho, the naive otaku Shinji in the teenage comedy Hana-Kimi and the lively street musician Mitsuru in the late night suspense Shigeshoshi, allowing Igarashi to develop his acting through various genres and different character types.\nJune 2007 marked Igarashi's theatre debut, guest-starring in the musical D-BOYS STAGE Volume 1: Kanbai Onrei, a D-BOYS project featuring all group members, in the same manner of the 2006 drama/documentary series DD-BOYS. In 2008 he will again guest star in D-BOYS STAGE Volume 2: Last Game. In October 2007 came Igarashi's radio debut with D-RADIO BOYS, another D-BOYS project. Igarashi hosts the weekly show with Shigeshoshi co-star Masato Wada, featuring guest D-BOYS members in each show.\nHe has also been chosen as a member of D-BOYS special unit D*DATE. After the successful release of D*Date's 2013 single \"Glory Days\", Igarashi Shunji declared his retirement by the end of November 2013 from the Entertainment Industry in one of the D8Date live performances. At the beginning of November prior Igarashi announcing his retirement, this announcement was officially introduced in the D-Boys official page.\nOn March 4, 2021 Igarashi has expressed in interest in returning to the entertainment industry.\n"

She won the 1st Kodansha Manga Award in 1977 as the artist of Candy Candy.In the late 1990s, Igarashi became involved in a number of legal battles related to her intellectual property rights as an illustrator. Igarashi claimed that in series for which she was the illustrator, she should hold sole intellectual property rights to the portrayals of the characters, and not need the consent of her authors to license merchandise based on their likenesses. In a dispute over the Candy Candy character designs in 1999, the court ruled against Igarashi, stating that both she and writer Kyoko Mizuki held equal rights to the characters, and awarded Mizuki reparations equal to 3% royalties on all the merchandise that had been created without her consent. This legal battle paralyzed the franchise for several years, interfering with Toei's production of a Candy Candy anime, and making the creation of new merchandise difficult due to the court's order that all merchandise be approved by both Igarashi and Mizuki. A trickle of new merchandise was produced in 2004, suggesting some agreement had been reached.\nIgarashi is a resident of Sapporo, Hokkaido. Satsuki Igarashi, a member of the manga circle Clamp, is her cousin.\nIgarashi married voice actor Kazuhiko Inoue and they later divorced. They have a son named Keiichi Igarashi (born 1981), known professionally as Nanami Igarashi, who is a former idol-trainee at Johnny & Associates and published a comic essay about his experiences as an otokonoko in 2010.\n"

Since that time, Ijaz has remained active as Crescent's owner, operating it as a quantitative investment adviser and venture investing firm.In the early 2000s, Crescent transitioned from a traditional hedge-fund management firm to a focus on venture investments, initially in homeland security technologies after the September 11 attacks. Ijaz formed and listed Crescent Technology Ventures PLC on London's AIM Stock Exchange to raise venture capital for his projects, but changes in AIM Rules for small-cap investment companies forced the start-up to de-list a year later. In the 2000s, Ijaz also launched an effort to finance and build what would have been the world's first underwater hotel, Hydropolis. Construction of this Dubai resort was projected to cost US$500 million in 2007, but was shelved by local authorities after the financial crisis of 2008. Crescent Hydropolis Holdings LLC continues operations today under private ownership.Crescent's venture investments included a bid together with its Abu Dhabi affiliate, Al Manhal International Group LLC, to acquire a stake in Formula One team Lotus F1. Quantum Motorsports Limited, a partnership between Crescent and Al Manhal, announced its intention to acquire 35% of Lotus F1 in June 2013. After several delays related to financing the deal, it did not take place.\nThrough his opinion pieces and political fundraising, Ijaz has advocated for the integration of Muslims into the American political mainstream. He raised significant amounts for various Democratic Party causes during the 1990s when President Clinton had paved the way for minority communities to become more active in U.S. politics, encouraging fellow Pakistani and Muslim Americans to join his fundraising efforts along the way. In 1996, Ijaz raised or contributed more than $525,000 for the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, bringing Ijaz into close proximity with Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Clinton as well as other Clinton administration national security officials with whom he would later engage on Sudan, Kashmir and Pakistan's nuclear program.Ijaz also used his fundraising results to advance his causes in Congress, appearing as an expert witness in front of committees in the Senate on extremist threats faced by the United States  and in the House of Representatives to advocate for Washington to adopt a policy of \"constructive engagement\" with rogue Muslim countries affected by U.S. sanctions. As Ijaz' prominence in Democratic Party circles increased, allegations of conflicts with his business interests also surfaced, although they were never proven. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Ijaz had a public falling out with senior Clinton-era officials, including the former president, Sandy Berger and Susan Rice, over what he deemed were failures in their counterterrorism policies during Clinton's two terms in office. In 2007, Nevada Republicans approached Ijaz to run against Sen. Harry Reid, in a bid to unseat the Senate Majority Leader, but Ijaz declined.Ijaz was a member of the board of directors of the Atlantic Council from 2007 until 2009, and he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations,\n"

Falling in love with photography, she <<<decided to enroll to study it>>> at the London College of Fashion, and it was during her time there that she started to become more concerned about some of the unsettling undertones in fashion imagery, particularly the stereotypes used in the portrayal of non-Western cultures. During her final year she started casting mixed-race models who fell outside the industry norm - something that has become central to her work.\nAfter graduating, Ijewere shunned the conventional career path of starting as a photographer's assistant, as she felt it important to   have the freedom to shoot in ways that would protect her own vision. Instead, she worked for an interior design company, maintaining her photographic passion by spending almost every spare moment and weekend photographing her mixed-raced friends.  By posting her early work on social media, she gradually built up her reputation, leading to professional commissions.Ijewere has worked with a large number of companies with fashion interests, including Dazed, i-D, Stella McCartney, Nike and Gap. In 2017 her work featured at Unseen and Lagos Photo Festival. More recently she has worked for Dior, Hermes, Nina Ricci and Valentino.At age 26, Ijewere became the first woman of colour to shoot a cover for Vogue, anywhere in the world. Her January 2019 cover for the UK edition featured images of Dua Lipa, Binx Walton, and Letitia Wright on the Kentish coast. Asked for her thoughts on the Vogue commission, she said, \"I feel like in doing this I'm proving to younger girls from a similar background that it's achievable. It also feels like part of a broader shift within our culture to include far more diversity, both behind the camera and in front of it. As a girl, I never identified with anyone in the pages of magazines. Now, we're sending a message that everyone is welcome in fashion.\"Ijewere does most of her model casting personally, often choosing models who do not conform to conventional industry standards.  She notes, \"I especially like to photograph those from ethnicities that are under-represented. London is such a diverse place and I feel that needs to be reflected within the fashion world.\" She has stated that her work is \"all about the celebration of diversity without creating a representation \u2013 particularly for women, as we are the ones who are more exposed to beauty ideals and to not being comfortable in who we are\".Ijewere's first book is a monograph titled Our Own Selves (2021).\n\n\n== References ==\n"

            "early_life": "Kang was born in Cheongwon-gun, a region now part of the city of Cheongju in Chungcheongbuk-do, South Korea, but grew up in Itaewon, a district in Seoul popular among ex-pats and U.S. military personnel for being closely located by the Yongsan Garrison of the United States Forces Korea (USFK). Kang had pursued art since a young age, having been encouraged by his family, known as descendants of many artists and scholars, such as Kang Sehwang (\uac15\uc138\ud669, \u59dc\u4e16\u6643, 1713\u20131791), an influential literati painter of the Joseon Dynasty (1392\u20131910).Kang's interest in art continued through high school, leading him to study painting at Hong-Ik University in Seoul and earn his BFA degree in 1984. Unsatisfied by his studies, Kang moved to New York to further study at Pratt Institute and earned his MFA in 1988. Kang has since lived and worked between Chelsea and Chinatown in Manhattan, New York City.:\u200a7\nAfter graduating from Pratt, Kang began working in his studio in Chinatown, among other artists of Asian descent. Frequenting together around Chinatown's affordable lunch spots was formed the Tuesday Lunch Club (TLC), including artists such as Arlan Huang, Bing Lee, Byron Kim, and Ken Chu. The casual social gatherings often involved discussions about the limited opportunities available for Asian American artists, who found themselves historically excluded from the art world. Born from the Tuesday Lunch Club meetings thus hatched the pan-Asian and Pacific Islander American artists' collective, Godzilla Asian American Arts Network, led by Lee, Chu, and Margo Machida in 1990.:\u200a12\u200a While Kang was not part of the founding members of Godzilla, he maintained close ties with many deeply involved.Kang had been exposed to and engaged with projects of the time that responded to racial inequalities nonetheless and participated in a number of shows curated by Asian American curators and art organizations, such as the Asian American Arts Centre. In 1990, Kang was among those coordinating the exhibition The Mosaic of the City: Artists Against Racial Prejudice held at the Skylight Gallery of the Center for Arts and Culture of Bedford Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. The Mosaic of the City was organized by Artists Against Racial Prejudice (AARP), \"a multi-ethnic group [of artists] that formed in reaction to the racial tension that has recently exploded in Brooklyn,\" signaling to the time's intraracial conflict between Korean American and African American communities that surfaced with the Family Red Apple boycott. Through the exhibition, the artists aimed to \"create an open forum where issues of racial prejudice can be addressed\". Among the seventy-five participating artists, mostly of Asian or African descent,:\u200a29\u201330\u200a were Korean American artists Ik-Joong Kang, Mo Bahc, Sung Ho Choi, Taeho Lee, Yeong Gill Kim, Kwangsung Lee, Oh Chi-Gyun, Hoyoon Choi, and William Jung.The works produced during the early years of his career grafted aspects of and his experiences between Korean and American culture. Kang's untitled series of drawings from 1992, on 3 \u00d7 3-inch pieces of paper, put alongside English words and phrases written in red and their Korean translations in blue. Buddha Learning English (1992\u20131994) was a series that followed, which paired seated Buddha images, a repeated motif found in Kang's oeuvre, with a recording of the artist reciting English phrases sampled from magazines, newspapers, and books.:\u200a8\u200a Chocolate also surfaced as a significant material incorporated into the artist's work, as exemplified in 8490 Days of Memory (1996), as a scarce and luxurious treat G.I.s gave out to children in post-war Korea that signaled America's plenitude.:\u200a2\n"

            "early_life": "Born in Kobe, Japan on 10 September 1930, Fumiko is the eldest daughter of the Buddhist  historian, Ikawa Joukei. She <<<studied English>>> at an early age at the suggestion of her mother, a secondary school teacher. She <<<graduated with an undergraduate degree>>> from Tsuada College which subsequently became Tsuda University in 1953 with her thesis on the critical essays by T. S. Eliot.She <<<used her proficiency in English to secure a clerical position>>> with Masao Oka, <<<an ethnologist at the department of sociology>>> at Tokyo Metropolitan University and assisted with his lectures and research. This experience led her to resign her position in 1954 in order to study anthropology as a postgraduate student at the same institution. Fumiko focused on the ancient civilisations of Central America which meant that she met Clyde Kluckhohn who in turn introduced her to American anthropology. He was in Japan in order to give a series of seminars on American Studies. This meeting caused her to take a leave of absence and obtain a Fulbright Program to study for a year at Harvard University.Fumiko had intended to specialise in Central American archaeology under Gordon Willey. But once she studied with Hallam Movius she decided to specialise in Early Palaeolithic cultures in [Asia]. She obtained an A. M. in anthropology, from Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, in 1958. In 1959 she married Philip E. L. Smith, an archaeologist interested in prehistory whom she had met at Harvard University. In 1960 they moved to Canada, with their son, as Philip had obtained a teaching job at the University of Toronto, Ontario. She obtained her PhD from Harvard University in 1974 with her doctoral thesis on the Early Palaeolithic cultures of Japan.\nShe accompanied her husband to excavate in Egypt, on the Canadian Expedition to Egyptian Nubia from September 1962 to May 1963. The small group was headed by Philip E.L. Smith, with the title of the \u201cCanadian Expedition to Egyptian Nubia\u201d, was Canadian government's contribution to the International salvage archaeology efforts in connection with the Aswan Dam construction. After spending the summer in Japan, they returned to Toronto for the academic year. Upon their return to Canada when Philip, her husband resumed teaching, she was employed with the Expedition funds as research assistant to sort and label artifacts. She subsequently became a lecturer in the department of anthropology at the University of Toronto. She started teaching part-time at McGill University in  Montreal in 1966 as her husband, Philip, started to teach at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. After a few years of part-time teaching, she was appointed assistant professor of anthropology in 1970, associate professor in 1974 and granted tenure. She obtained her PhD from Harvard University in 1974 for her dissertation on the Early Palaeolithic cultures of Japan. She was promoted to associate professor in 1975. A year after she obtained her PhD in 1975, she became the chair of the anthropology department at  McGill University.   She became professor in 1979.Fumiko has two strands in her career: a university administrator and a researcher. She was the chair of the anthropology department in 1975, soon after being granted tenure and promoted to Associate Professor. She suspected that she was promoted to chair as each of the well-established full professors in the department: Peter Gutkind, Richard Anthony Salisbury, and Bruce G. Trigger might try to influence her. She is reported to have said that she thought at the time that each established academic thought he could persuade her to carry out his own agenda, as \"I was a woman, a Japanese woman at that, who is supposed to be docile. I think I became a chair not \"in spite of\" being a woman, but \"because\" of being a woman.\u201dShe was director of the Centre for East Asian Studies at McGill University between 1983 and 1988. She was the associate vice-principal (academic) of McGill University in 1991 until 1996. This was, at the time, the highest-ranking position a woman had ever been appointed to at McGill University. She later discovered that she obtained the job \"because of\" her  gender as the vice-principal (academic), who was a male  biologist, was looking for a female  humanities person to be his associate vice-principal. She was appointed as associate vice-principal (academic) in 1991. This position meant that she assisted in the development of both research units by obtaining external grants to add teaching positions in the Centre for East Asian Studies and to invite numerous visiting professors from Japan. As associate vice-principal (academic) part of her duties entailed the creation of academic exchanges and collaboration agreements with universities outside of  Canada, strengthening McGill's  presence in Asia. She was charged to undertake this task in Asia by then principal of the university, David Johnston, latterly Governor General of Canada. She helped to establish more than dozen agreements between  McGill University and universities in Japan and to create the existing programme for Japanese students to spend the summer at McGill University studying English and Canadian culture.She is research active despite having retired from McGill University in 2003. She held two visiting professorships: one at Kwansei Gakuin University, Japan in 1996-1997 and another at El Colegio de M\u00e9xico, Mexico City, Mexico in October 2002\n"

Claiming to have in fact been sixteen years of age when she starred in this softcore sex film, Ike caused a scandal. The publicity only served to make the film one of Toei's most profitable films of the 1970s.In her third film, director Norifumi Suzuki's Modern Porno Tale: Inherited Sex Mania (1971), Ike co-starred with French erotic actress, Sandra Julien. Eirin, the Japanese film-rating board, objected to the graphic lesbian scenes between the two actresses, and this film had to be severely cut before it could be released theatrically. Ike decided to stop performing in nude scenes after this film, concentrating instead on films in the delinquent girl subgenre of S&M films. Ike starred in five of Toei's seven Sukeban (delinquent schoolgirl) films made between 1971 and 1974. Patrick Macias describes this series as, \"bare-chested, shotgun-packing chicks Miki Sugimoto and Ike Reiko getting into one catfight after another.\" She also starred in all four of Toei's Terror Female High School films made in 1972 and 1973.

His parents later adopted two more children, for a total of 10 children. Since the mid-nineteenth century, the Ikeda family had successfully farmed nori, edible seaweed, in Tokyo Bay. By the turn of the twentieth century, the Ikeda family business was the largest producer of nori in Tokyo. The devastation of the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake left the family's enterprise in ruins; by the time Ikeda was born, his family was financially struggling.:\u200a13\u200aIn 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War erupted, and Ikeda's eldest brother, Kiichi, was drafted into military service. Within a few years, Ikeda's three other elder brothers were drafted as well. In 1942, while all of his older brothers were overseas in the South-East Asian theatre of World War II, Ikeda's father, Nenokichi, fell ill and was bedridden for two years. To help to support his family, at the age of 14, Ikeda began working in the Niigata Steelworks munitions factory as part of Japan's wartime youth labor corps.:\u200a71\u200aIn May 1945, Ikeda's home was destroyed by fire during an Allied air raid, and his family was forced to move to the \u014cmori area of Tokyo.

It was there that he met Josei Toda, the second president of Japan's Soka Gakkai Buddhist organization. As a result of this encounter, Ikeda began practicing Nichiren Buddhism and joined the Soka Gakkai. He regarded Toda as his spiritual mentor and became a charter member of the group's youth division, later recounting that Toda influenced him through \"the profound compassion that characterized each of his interactions.\"\nShortly after the end of World War II, in January 1946, Ikeda gained employment with the Shobundo Printing Company in Tokyo. In March 1948, Ikeda graduated from Toyo Trade School and the following month entered the night school extension of Taisei Gakuin (present-day Tokyo Fuji University) where he majored in political science. During this time, he worked as an editor of the children's magazine Shonen Nihon (Boy's Life Japan), which was published by one of Josei Toda's companies.:\u200af. 84\u200a Over the next several years, between 1948 and 1953, Ikeda worked for various Toda-owned enterprises, including the Nihon Shogakkan publishing company, the Tokyo Construction Trust credit association, and the Okura Shoji trading company.:\u200a76\nIkeda lives in Tokyo with his wife, Kaneko Ikeda (n\u00e9e Kaneko Shiraki), whom he married on 3 May 1952.

The single failed to chart.\nIn April 1973, Suzee released her first single on the Motown label, a ballad written by Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel called, \"Time For Me to Go.\"  Unfortunately, the single and her solo career went nowhere.During her tenure at Motown she was described as a \"creative confidant\" of Michael Jackson. \u201cMichael Jackson could make you forget he was so young,\u201d writes Suzee Ikeda, in her introductory essay to Hello World: The Complete Motown Solo Collection.Ikeda's rapport with artists soon led to a new role behind the scenes as a production executive for the company. One of her early projects was the A Song for You album by The Temptations, released in 1975.\nIn 1983, Ikeda became one of  the principal players in Super Three, a division of Motown responsible for developing new and existing acts.

            "early_life": "Ikeda Tatsuo was born in Imari, Saga prefecture in 1928 as the eldest son of a stonemason.:\u200a196\u200a As a young witness to the escalation of imperial aggression and militarist ideology through the 1930s and early 40s, Ikeda's early education was heavily shaped by the nationalist sentiments that colored the atmosphere of the era. After enrolling in Imari Commercial High School in 1941, he was put in a military training course, where he recalled hearing the broadcast of the Imperial Japanese Navy's entrance into war in the Pacific following the bombing of Pearl Harbor.In 1943, at the age of 15, Ikeda and his classmates were called upon to volunteer to serve in the armed forces. Told to commit on the spot without consulting their families, Ikeda was the first of his class to stand up and volunteer, prompted by a conviction that he would eventually have to serve regardless. He was subsequently drafted into the Imperial Japanese Navy to train as a kamikaze pilot in Kagoshima.:\u200a196\u200a Before he was dispatched on a suicide mission, the war came to an end, allowing him to escape the fate that befell his fellow pilots.<<<The end of the war left>>> Ikeda <<<with a sense of traumatic disillusionment>>>, and he described his sentiments during this period as follows: \"Young people had grown up being fed the lesson that sacrifice for the country and becoming a god enshrined at Yasukuni [i.e., dying in the war] was the road to eternal righteousness. We were all hurtling down that road with no time to think. When the road suddenly cut off, it led to great sorrow and confusion.\u201d:\u200a79\u200aAfter the dismissal of the pilots, Ikeda took a four-day journey from Kasumigaura to Imari. Upon passing through Hiroshima, he recalled seeing an \"utterly empty landscape, which felt absolutely horrible. At the time, there was not yet a word for 'atomic bomb', so we had just seen flyers that read 'Enemy drops new type of bomb.'\" Ikeda reached Saga in late August 1945, and <<<enrolled in a teaching school>>> later that year after learning that his middle school credentials would be accepted.:\u200a196\u200a \"I <<<didn't want to be a teacher>>>,\" Ikeda recalled. \"I just wanted to learn, and also not have to pay tuition.\"However, after the GHQ prohibited former military personnel from taking teaching positions due to suspicions regarding the potential of lingering militarist sentiments to seep into postwar education practices, Ikeda was expelled from the teaching school in 1946.:\u200a196\u200a After working on a base in Sasebo, Nagasaki, a land reclamation project in Imari Bay, and briefly <<<apprenticing>>> <<<at a>>> Nabeshima ware <<<pottery studio>>>, Ikeda resolved to pursue the visual arts, and made his first oil painting, a self-portrait made in the style of Tsune Nakamura\u2019s Portrait of Vasilii Yaroschenko (1920).:\u200a22\u200a Ikeda gained admission to the Tama Art and Design School (now Tama Art University) with the painting as part of his portfolio, and moved to Tokyo in 1948 to begin his studies.\nThough he had originally enrolled with the intention of studying oil painting, Ikeda quickly lost interest in academism and instead began to immerse himself in Tokyo's avant-garde circles.:\u200a138\u200a Ikeda's classmates at Tama included Hiroshi Katsuragawa and Masahiro Mori. At the invitation of a friend, he joined Tar\u014d Okamoto and Kiyoteru Hanada's Avant-garde Art Study Group, which brought together artists and writers to discuss and debate the paths to developing artistic paradigms that broke free from the clutches of the old militarist order.:\u200a138\u200a Ikeda quickly grew disillusioned with the conservatism of the university and his instructors. After seeing a portrait of the imperial crown prince on a ski holiday by Ihara Usaburo, one of his professors, that confirmed his ambivalence about the academy, Ikeda dropped out in late 1948.:\u200a80\u200aThe study group was but one of the many collectives (many of which shared members and goals) formed during the early postwar years that sought to redefine creative production amidst a rapidly changing and unstable political milieu, reimagine the social role of creatives, encourage artistic experimentation, and provide publishing and exhibition platforms. As few formal exhibition spaces and sponsoring bodies supporting avant-garde art existed at the time, many artists in early postwar Japan took it upon themselves to organize their own shows. Members of the group included writers Kiichi Sasaki, K\u014db\u014d Abe, photographer Sh\u014dz\u014d Kitadai, and artists Katsuhiro Yamaguchi and Hideko Fukushima.:\u200a138\u200aThough these groups were short-lived, they provided a crucial intellectual foundation, marked by Marxist and Surrealist influences, that influenced a generation of post-war artists and movements. Younger artists broke off from the groups to form collections such as Jikken K\u014db\u014d.:\u200a91\u200a Ikeda, who also affiliated with groups such as Seiki no Kai, NON, and Seibiren, participated in a number of organizations independently organized by the groups. Seibiren\nHis works from the early 1950s, which feature fragmentary geometries and constellated symbols demarcated by strong, dark outlines reveal the influences of Cubism and Surrealism on the young artist\u2019s nascent practice. At the encouragement of Okamoto Taro, Ikeda submitted his work to the second annual  Yomiuri Ind\u00e9pendant Exhibition in 1950.\n"

Though most awarded and recognized as a director, Ikejima has continued acting to the present day.He began his directorial career in 1988, at first working mainly in AVs (adult videos). His cinematic theatrical debut as a director was The Masturbating Lesbian (\u30b6\u30fb\uff2f\uff2e\uff21\uff2e\uff29\uff25\u30ec\u30ba, Za Onanie Rezu) (1991). Through his production company Cement Match, Ikejima both stages plays and self-produces film. Cement Match has made films for all of the major pink film distribution companies, but most often produces for OP Eiga. Through this company he has produced such prominent pink films as Daisuke Goto's A Lonely Cow Weeps at Dawn (2003) and ENK's The Gays in Wonderland (1997). Also active in gay-themed films in both acting and directing careers, the 1996 gay film, Love Me Danger, directed by Ikejima, was chosen the 6th Best Film at the Pink Grand Prix. His Men Who Love (2002) was one of the first pink films to be shown at the Tokyo International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival.In his pink film directorial career, Ikejima usually collaborates with his wife, screenwriter Ky\u014dko Godai, who had previously made a name for herself scripting for Hisayasu Sat\u014d. Known for his professionalism and efficiency, when the original pink film version of The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai went over-budget and behind schedule (because of its ambition and precarious production history, Jasper Sharp characterizes it as the Apocalypse Now of the pink film world), Ikejima was called in to film a temporary replacement, a task he accomplished in a few days. In 2008 Ikejima directed his 100th pink film, an accomplishment for which he was given a special award at the Pink Grand Prix.\n"

Due to Matt Murray's long-term injury, he was promoted to the substitutes' bench for a string of games but never played.\nHe moved on a month-long loan to Conference Premier side Accrington Stanley on 14 October 2004, to fill the gap in their team caused by Jon Kennedy's broken leg. He made his senior debut on 16 October when he played the first of four games for them, keeping a clean sheet in a goalless draw at Aldershot Town.\nHe finally made his Wolves debut the following season, in a 5\u20131 win over Chester City in the League Cup second round on 23 August 2005. He also had a further loan move to Stockport County in late 2005 which was cut short due to a hand injury. On 26 August 2006, he made his league debut for Wolves when he appeared as a late substitute in a 1\u20130 home win over Luton Town, replacing Murray for the final three minutes.Ikeme suffered a knee injury during the 2006\u201307 season and had to undergo surgery, which kept him out of contention until late 2007. After recovering, he was an unused substitute or only employed in reserve team fixtures. It was not until September 2008 that he got his chance to return to Wolves' first team after regular keeper Wayne Hennessey was suspended. He enjoyed his longest run of games in a Wolves shirt until injury ruled him out for the remainder of the season, during which the club went on to claim the Championship title and reach the Premier League.\nIkeme was born in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, and was eligible to represent England or Nigeria at international level, choosing the latter. He was first called up to the \"Super Eagles\" squad in March 2007 by new manager Berti Vogts, who named a 37-man provisional squad for a 2008 Africa Cup of Nations qualification match against Uganda that introduced other foreign-born players such as Gabriel Agbonlahor, Victor Anichebe and Toto Tamuz.He made his international debut for Nigeria on 5 September 2015 against Tanzania in a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification game. Ikeme made three appearances early on in Nigeria's successful qualification campaign for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but could not go to the final tournament due to his cancer treatment, which manager Gernot Rohr called his greatest regret.\nIkeme is a practitioner of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and has reached the rank of blue belt, along with winning the British Open and earning a bronze medal at the IBJJF European Championship.\n"

            "early_life": "As a child Ikemoto was a fan of Bikkuriman stickers. However, since he could not afford them, he instead <<<drew>>> his own <<<stickers>>>. Ikemoto's friends enjoyed them so much that they started buying stickers from him. By this point of his life, Ikemoto felt he <<<had the talent for art>>>.In March 1997, Mikio Ikemoto submitted his first one-shot manga, titled Cosmos, to the manga magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump, for which he won a Tenkaichi Manga Award. The one-shot was later published in the July 7 issue of the magazine, gaining a small cult following despite its mature subject matter. Cosmos was then serialized in Monthly Plasma, an independent manga magazine, from June 1997 to September 1999, and a sequel one-shot was published in the April 26, 1999 issue of Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump.\nBy this time Ikemoto had become interested in the work of fellow rookie manga artist Masashi Kishimoto. Upon hearing that Ikemoto had been contacted by Shueisha to work as an assistant on a comedy series and was moving to Tokyo, Kishimoto felt that his art would be wasted on that genre. With work beginning on the Naruto serialization, Kishimoto asked his editor, Kosuke Yahagi, to scout Ikemoto and recruit him as an assistant. Ikemoto was grateful for the offer, since he felt that Naruto's genre was what he had originally wanted to work on, and accepted the job, beginning work with the seventh chapter. During the early days of making Naruto, Ikemoto was Kishimoto's youngest assistant, and the latter jokingly said this made him and his other assistants envious. Ikemoto's responsibilities included drawing crowds and background figures, adding white to speed lines, highlights and characters' eyes, whiting out art that went out of the panels, putting stars in night skies, and adding in half-tones. He was also occasionally tasked with creating the designs for new characters. Ikemoto recalls how often Kishimoto requested his help with adding more details to the manga chapters, leading him to draw more clones created by Naruto Uzumaki as well as an unspecified character who could become giant.When the manga ended in 2014, Shueisha asked Kishimoto to start a sequel. However, Kishimoto rejected the idea and proposed that Ikemoto draw it based on the experience he had. Kishimoto advised Ikemoto not to imitate his art style and instead make his own. While noting long-time fans might be disappointed with the fact that Kishimoto is not drawing Boruto, Ikemoto stated he would do his best in the making of the manga. Ikemoto mentioned he remained optimistic about his art style. Kishimoto also revises the manga's scenario. Besides illustrating the manga, Ikemoto also provides illustrations for the Boruto light novels. The manga had one million copies in print as of January 2017 while Studio Pierrot also produced an anime series based on it.\n"

The fight is most famous for Zaromskis backflipping onto Ikemoto, almost getting caught in a leg lock in the process.\nOn November 8, 2010, he made his kickboxing debut against veteran fighter Yuya Yamamoto at K-1 World MAX 2010 Final, and lost via knockout in the first round.\nIkemoto lost his retirement fight to Japanese MMA legend Ryo Chonan on April 28, 2013, at Deep: Osaka Impact 2013.Ikemoto is occasionally a professional wrestler and had appeared for All Japan Pro Wrestling and GLEAT.\n"

He was Formule France champion in 1968 \u2013 driving for the works GRAC team, and taking 11 victories from the series' 17 events \u2013 in a field that included future two-time 24 Hours of Le Mans race winner G\u00e9rard Larrousse and future Formula One driver Jean-Pierre Jarier. His success encouraged Ecurie GRAC to construct a Formula Three car for him to run in 1969, but results were meager. He finished tenth at the Pau round and seventh in Dijon, but these were his only two race finishes in the French championship and he frequently failed to qualify for races.In 1970 he parted company from GRAC and secured funding from the lubricants manufacturer Motul to run a works-supported Tecno car. At the opening race of the season, in Nogaro, he finished in second position. He repeated this placing in the fourth and fifth rounds of the championship at Linas-Montlh\u00e9ry and Magny-Cours. However, apart from a sixth placed finish in round eight at Dijon and ninth on aggregate at the second visit to Nogaro, he did not reach the finishing flag in any of his other appearances, having suffered from a variety of mechanical failures. Nevertheless, despite his disappointing performances in Formula Three, he was drafted into the works Tecno team for Formula Two races at Paul Ricard in France and Tulln-Langenlebarn in Austria, where he finished in seventh and 13th places, respectively.\nIn 1971 Jean took his Motul sponsorship to the independent Frank Williams Racing Cars team, and he drove their March 712M Formula Two car for them at Rouen and Pau. However, on both occasions he failed to finish. He also failed to qualify the car for the Monza Lottery race in June. His involvement with the Williams team gave Jean the opportunity to participate in his home Formula One event that year: the 1971 French Grand Prix at Paul Ricard in July. As Williams had upgraded their lead driver, Jean's compatriot Henri Pescarolo, to a 1971-model March 711 car the team's 1970-specification March 701 was available. Jean qualified the 701 in 23rd place in the 24 car field, but started in 22nd position following the withdrawal of March works driver Nanni Galli. During the race Jean's car suffered from a malfunctioning gearbox and he finished the race unclassified and last, nine laps behind the winner.\nAfter 1971 Jean's racing activities reduced. In 1972 he took part in two Formula Two races for the Rondel Racing team, who also benefitted from Motul sponsorship. He failed to qualify the team's Brabham BT38 for the Pau round, and finished in 13th position in August's race at Albi. In 1973 Jean re-entered the French Formula Three championship, driving an Automobiles Martini car for the ORECA team. Following a season of low points and no points finishes and retirements, at the end of the year Motul cut their sponsorship and Jean retired.Following the conclusion of his racing career, Max Jean built a successful family business in transport.\n"

On April 16, 2003, Jean's mom took her to Detroit's Masonic Temple to see her first concert, The White Stripes.By high school, Jean was a self-taught multi-instrumentalist and songwriter who spent her free time recording her own music using a computer microphone and layering the individual instrument recordings on top of each other using a free music editing program. At 16, she began playing small clubs around Detroit and handing out her homemade demo CDs to friends, family, and co-workers. \u201cIt was a hobby,\u201d she stated to the New York Times in 2022. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could make money off of music.\u201dAfter high school, Jean enrolled in graphic design school.\nAfter The Black Belles disbanded in 2012, Jean took about a year off before going back into the studio.

With Tedi Tafel (choreography and performance), Jacques Perron (photography) and Monique Jean (music), he founded Les Productions de l'Os in 1986. A series of performances resulted from this collaboration, which culminated in 1989 with the creation of his first choregraphed short film, La d\u00e9route.\nIn 1995, he directed a documentary, La voix des rivi\u00e8res, on Acadians of New-Brunswick, with the support of the National Film Board in Acadia, as well as two short fiction films, La m\u00e9moire de l'eau (1996), and L'appel/Call Waiting (1998).\nRodrigue Jean then directed three award-winning feature films: the Acadian trilogy Full Blast (1999), Yellowknife (2001) and Lost Song (2008), that earned him the recognition of critics and made his name as a leading filmmaker. In 2005, with the documentary Living on the Edge, he celebrated the work of the Acadian poet G\u00e9rald Leblanc.\nDuring a stay in London in the early 1990s, he worked as a theatre director. He also organised video workshops at Streetwise Youth, a sex worker centre in London (1991\u201398). Between 2005 and 2007, after several decades trying to fund this project, he directed the documentary Men for Sale, offering a striking portrait of sex workers in downtown Montreal. In 2009, he founded Epop\u00e9e, a film action group born out of a co-creation project with the participants of Men for Sale. With Epop\u00e9e, he deepened his engagement with sex workers, in collaboration with the organization R\u00c9ZO.This collective work, composed of documentaries and fiction films, led to the creation of the installation L\u2019\u00c9tat des lieux (2012), and two feature films, L\u2019\u00c9tat du moment (2012) and L\u2019\u00c9tat du monde (2012). Deepening his research into misrepresented lives, and in continuation with Men for Sale and Epop\u00e9e, he directed in 2014 the fiction feature Love in the Time of Civil War.\nBesides the project on masculine sex work, the collective launched the installation Fractions, presented at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise in 2016, and the triptych Insurgence (2013), Rupture (2016), and Contrepoint (2016) on the great political and social movement launched by the 2012 Quebec Student Strike. Epop\u00e9e also worked on the massive incarceration of Indigenous women in Canada, with the installation The Reappearance of Sheri Pranteau (2018), which was presented as a triptych at the Joliette Museum of Art.\nHis latest feature film, The Acrobat, was released in 2020.\nNavigating between documentary and fiction, often mixing genres, and combining ethics and aesthetics, Rodrigue Jean develops a cinematic practice, either by representing people who are deprived of a voice, or by inventing characters driven by their impulses and their desires. Through these two practices of cinema, he examines and questions the constructions of identity and sexuality that stand up against the imperatives of any form of normativity.\n"

When the Korean War broke out, Jo Jeong-rae and his family evacuated to the South, where he was unpopular with the local children and frequently fought with them, fights he generally lost. He was interested in literature from early in life, and won competitions in elementary school. He majored in Korean literature at Dongguk University, and <<<worked as a high school teacher>>> for several years after graduation. His <<<literary debut>>> was in 1970 when he published the short story \"A False Charge\" (\ub204\uba85), after which he decided to devote his entire life to literature.\nJo Jeong-rae's popular multi-volume novels Taebaek Mountain Range (\ud0dc\ubc31\uc0b0\ub9e5, 1983-1989) and Arirang (\uc544\ub9ac\ub791, 1995), both of which have come to be considered modern classics since their publication in the 1980s, are widely considered to be the epitome of his talent. With the publication of his novel Han River (\ud55c\uac15, 2002), Jo Jeong-rae finally completed his trilogy of works dedicated to modern Korean history. Sales of the series reached record-breaking numbers in South Korea, selling over 10 million copies.The epic historical trilogy, begun in 1983 and eventually completed in 2002, comprises Jo Jeong-rae's three most well-known novels: Taebaek Mountain Range, Arirang, and Han River. Each novel is over ten volumes in length, and each deals with different aspects of the turbulent history of Korea in the modern era. The first novel, Taebaek Mountain Range, examines the five-year period between the liberation of Korea from Japanese colonial rule in 1945 to the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, with detailed flashbacks and backstory contextualizing the deep ideological conflict that culminated in violence and the division of Korea. The second novel, Arirang, is technically a prequel to Taebaek Mountain Range, and covers the Japanese colonial period of Korean history.One of the primary themes in Jo Jeong-rae's work, concern regarding the socio-economic roots of the division of Korea and the search for Korean reunification, is also present in his other, shorter works of fiction, particularly his later works, such as \"Sorrow, That Shaded Place\" (\ud55c \uadf8 \uadf8\ub298\uc758 \uc790\ub9ac), \"Land of Exile\" (\uc720\ud615\uc758 \ub545), \"Human Stairs\" (\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uacc4\ub2e8), and \"The Soul of a Barren Land\" (\ubc15\ud1a0\uc758 \ud63c). Many of his earlier works, however, such as \"A Woman from Cheongsan\" (\uccad\uc0b0\ub301), \"The Violent Instructor\" (\ud401\ub140\uc11d \uad50\uc0ac), \"The Shaded Slope\" (\ube44\ud0c8\uc9c4 \uc74c\uc9c0), \"The Age of Geocentrism\" (\ucc9c\ub3d9\uc124 \uc2dc\ub300), and \"Foreign Land\" (\uc774\ubc29\uc9c0\ub300), tend to reconstruct stories of traditional rustic life, targeting and satirizing the various absurdities of life in a much more general fashion.\n"

He <<<started learning music from a very young age>>>, upon the wishes of his mother, who <<<dreamt of being a singer>>>. She supported both of her children to <<<learn music>>>, Jo's older sister studied piano. In 1998, the family moved to Chuncheon. After his sister stopped playing the piano in 2004, Jo's mother turned her full attention to the <<<musical education>>> of her son, which he considers to be a turning point in his life.In 2006, he was admitted to Seoul Arts High School, then in 2009, he started his education at Seoul National University, studying vocal music. He participated in several singing competitions, where he became a semi-finalist, finalist or winner. In 2011, he became the youngest finalist of the DongA Music Competition. This year he lent his singing voice to actor Lee David in the war film The Front Line.During this period, he became unsure of his future, as he failed to win several competitions and received harsh criticism. In 2013, he decided to further his studies at Seoul National University's graduate school. Here, he found new inspiration under the supervision of opera singer and university professor Kwangchul Youn. He also gave singing lessons at the university dorm. He started working for the Seoul Metropolitan Opera and participated in various stages.In 2015, he was a semi-finalist at the Montreal International Musical Competition, after which he started his compulsory military service as a conscripted policeman.  In 2016, at the Geneva International Music Competition, he was told he would not be able to get lead singing roles in opera, due to his light leggero tone. This shook his view of his future and considered quitting singing when he came across the first season of Phantom Singer and decided to apply for the second season. He thought crossover music might be a viable solution for his voice type.During the competition, Jo selected Ko Woo-rim for the 2nd round of the competition and trained him. Then, he selected Bae Doo-hoon for the 3rd round of the competition to add variety to the team color. In the final competition, Kang Hyung-ho joined the team. Jo Mingyu got the nickname \"Strategist\" during the competition because he meticulously considered each contestant's timbre and whether they would match his voice before selecting them.His first solo single, titled \"Sinsegye: New Age\" (\uc2e0\uc138\uacc4: New Age) was released in February 2020. In December 2021, he released his first minialbum, Sinsegye: Parana (\uc2e0\uc138\uacc4: Parana), followed by a two-day solo concert in Seoul.\n"

Her mother was a kindergarten teacher, and her father was a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official. She displayed interest in music and performance from an early age, practicing ballet and hip-hop dance. Jovanovi\u0107 cites late 90's and early 00's performers like Britney Spears, TLC, Jennifer Lopez and Destiny's Child as her biggest influences in music.In 2009, the family eventually permanently relocated to Belgrade, where Sara graduated from the Third Grammar School. She subsequently studied Italian language at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology.\nJovanovi\u0107 <<<began>>> her <<<music career>>> in 2011 <<<by winning a contest>>> organized by Serbian magazine Story with covers she had been posting on YouTube.

During the first semi-finals of Eurovision, which took place on May 14, Moje 3 performed as the last act of the evening, eventually placing 11th with 46 points, and thus failing to progress to the final. Furthermore, they received the Barbara Dex Award for the worst dressed act.Following the Eurovision, Jovanovi\u0107 pursued a solo career with \"Ujutru\" (In the Morning), released under IDJTunes, in collaboration with Marko Mandi\u0107, which was featured on his 2015 debut EP. Between September and December, she appeared on the first Serbian series of Your Face Sounds Familiar, winning in the 10th episode with the performance of \"Unconditionally\" as Katy Perry.

In March 2015, she released the ballad \"Mahovina\" (Moss) and, later in July 2016, reggae-infused \"Probaj\" (Try It).

She portrayed Cinderella as a main role in a musical, which premiered at Belgrade's Sava Centar on December 25, and later toured in theaters around Serbia.\nJovanovi\u0107 was in a year-long relationship with volleyball player Aleksandar Atanasijevi\u0107, which was ended in May 2014.

            "early_life": "After majoring in industrial design at Seoul National University, Jo Sung-hee joined the Seo Taiji Company and Olive Studio, a children's animation company. During his time at these companies, he worked on numerous music videos and animated films as an assistant director. He also directed the 52-episode animated television series Barnacle Lou (\ub530\uac1c\ube44 \ub8e8), which aired on EBS in 2007.Jo then studied film directing at the prestigious Korean Academy of Film Arts (KAFA). He got admitted by submitting a film he made with his friends for pure fun. Among his classmates at KAFA was Yoon Sung-hyun, who would go on to direct Bleak Night. One of Jo's teachers was Oh Seung-uk, screenwriter of award-winning romance Christmas in August, who taught him that \"a director should trust his own abilities, but should always challenge their own works and expand their experiences.\"In 2008 he wrote and directed the 43-minute short film Don't Step Out of the House (\ub0a8\ub9e4\uc758 \uc9d1), in which two impoverished children are menaced by strangers in the basement of a house. The short won several awards in 2009, including Best Picture at the Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne Short Film Festival and the Seoul Independent Film Festival, the Eastar Jet Award (Best Korean Short Film) at the Jeonju International Film Festival, and Third Prize at the Cin\u00e9fondation section of the Cannes Film Festival. It was later included in the omnibus Nice Shorts (released in 2009).As his graduation film for KAFA, Jo made his feature debut in 2010 with End of Animal (\uc9d0\uc2b9\uc758 \ub05d), starring Lee Min-ji and Park Hae-il. Part apocalypse, part horror, part mystery movie, the plot follows a young woman in the last month of her pregnancy who runs into a series of ordeals and uncanny misfortunes while trying to get to her hometown to give birth. The film drew acclaim from local critics and in the international film festival circuit.Jo surprised the film industry in 2012 with his second feature. Unlike his previous films which delved into the intricacies of the human psyche and had been called \"dark, even grotesque,\" A Werewolf Boy (\ub291\ub300\uc18c\ub144) was a fantasy romance starring popular actors Song Joong-ki and Park Bo-young. Though admittedly commercial, Jo said he didn't compromise a lot in making the film and that he'd \"always wanted to make a movie that can be widely watched and enjoyed by all generations.\" It also retained the whimsical sense of humor and creeping sense of doubt that characterized his previous works. The coming-of-age film takes place in a rural Korean town in the 1960s, where a teenage girl meets a feral boy who can neither read nor speak. She teaches him civilized human behavior using a dog-training manual, and the two fall in love, but the mystery of his origins and the townspeople's fear threaten their idyll. After its world premiere at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, domestically the film reached nearly 7 million admissions to become the third best-selling Korean film of 2012 and currently the most successful Korean melodrama of all time. Jo received the 2013 Discovery Award from the Korea Film Reporters Association, and Best New Director from the 2013 Baeksang Arts Awards.In 2021, he was selected as jury member for Bucheon Choice Features section of 25th Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival held in July.\n"

            ],
            "early_life": "Joanou was born in La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, California, and began making short films on super-8 when he was 14 years old. Joanou studied at UCLA's theater department and then moved on to USC's cinema program. His award winning student film Last Chance Dance caught the eye of Steven Spielberg who hired him to direct two Amazing Stories episodes, \"Santa '85\" and \"The Doll\", when he was 23 years old. John Lithgow won a best actor Emmy Award for his role in \"The Doll\" and memorably said in his acceptance speech, \"I'd like to thank the director, Phil Joanou -- remember that name.\"\nSpielberg then offered Joanou his first feature film, Three O'Clock High. Filmed in Ogden, Utah, on a five-million-dollar budget, the black comedy was released in 1987. Although the film was not a box-office success in its initial run, it went on to become a cult favorite with a huge following. While in post-production on Three O'Clock High, Joanou was introduced to the Irish rock band U2, and after a series of discussions, they asked him to direct their 1988 film Rattle and Hum. The film chronicled the band's Joshua Tree Tour as they moved across the United States at the end of 1987. Joanou operated the camera for the documentary portion of the shoot and edited over one million feet of film into the final movie. The film divided critics upon release; it premiered in five cities: Dublin, London, Madrid, New York and Los Angeles in a one week period. Joanou's collaboration with U2 continued on for over twenty years with the director shooting nine music videos for the band as well as a documentary (\"40 Cents a Day\") that covered Bono's journey throughout Africa for One and Project Red. His other collaborations with the band include: \"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\" -- \"If God Will Send His Angeles\" -- \"Merry Christmas, Baby Please Come Home\" -- \"One Tree Hill\" -- \"When Love Comes to Town\" -- \"All Because of You\" and \"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\".\nJoanou also collaborated with Tom Petty on two music videos. The first, \"You Don't Know How it Feels\" won the MTV award for best rock video and the second, \"Walls (circus version)\" was a part of the \"She's the One\" soundtrack.  He also directed videos for Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey (\"When You Believe\") as well as Bon Jovi (\"Keep the Faith\").\nAfter the release of Rattle and Hum, Joanou went on to direct the Irish gangster drama, State of Grace. The film starred Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, and Robin Wright. It was released by Orion Pictures in September 1990, the same week as Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. The film received positive reviews, but was eclipsed by the Scorsese film.\nIn 1990 Joanou directed the American version of Michael Apted's British Up documentary series. The original film, as well as this US version, followed a group of seven-year-old children to see how they would evolve over the course of their lives, re-visiting them every seven years. The first installment directed by Joanou, Age 7 in America, was hosted by Meryl Streep and introduced on network television by Oprah Winfrey. It went on to win a Peabody award for best documentary that same year.\nIn 1991 Joanou directed the psychological thriller, Final Analysis. The film starred Richard Gere and Kim Basinger. The film was shot by Joanou's frequent collaborator Jordan Cronenweth (his last feature film) and featured a reproduction of the interior of the Pigeon Point Lighthouse by the acclaimed production designer Dean Tavoularis. Released in 1992, the film was well received, but turned out to be only a moderate box-office success.\nAfter several brief forays into TV - directing an episode of the mini-series Wild Palms and an installment of the anthology series Fallen Angels -  Joanou returned to features with his Alec Baldwin vehicle, Heaven's Prisoners. Based on the James Lee Burke novel of the same name, the film was shot in New Orleans in the summer of 1994. The production was beset by myriad of problems and Joanou was said to be very frustrated by the experience with Savoy Pictures (who financed the film). The company went bankrupt before Joanou was able to complete the movie and the film was released in a compromised state. Both Joanou and Baldwin attempted to raise the funds to \"finish the movie right\" outside of the studio, but were unable to do so.After the disappointment of Heaven's Prisoners Joanou went into the indie world of filmmaking to write, direct, produce and edit Entropy. Produced by Brad Epstein, Robert DeNiro and Jane Rosenthal at Tribeca Films, this semi-autobiographical film (starring Stephen Dorff as the Joanou-inspired character) was independently produced for three million dollars while shooting in New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Dublin and Cape Town. Five U2 songs were used on the soundtrack, and the band also performed live, while Bono and Larry Mullen Jr. played themselves as characters in the film. The film was ultimately purchased by Touchstone Pictures (Disney) and was never heard from again.\nThe second installment of the American Up series, 14 Up in America, was completed in 1998 when Joanou filmed the same children, now 14 years old. In 2005, due to a conflict with a feature film Joanou was directing (Gridiron Gang), rather than wait until the Sony film was finished, Granda Television (the producer of the documentary project) chose to move forward with a different director for Age 21 in America. This installment was never aired in the US and the project was abandoned.In the early 2000's Joanou focused on commercial work, directing commercials for Nike, Coke, Gatorade, Bud Light, Honda, Ford, GM, Lexus, Brand Jordan, Sony, UPS, Microsoft, EA, Mercedes, Disney, Visa, MasterCard, and many others.\nIn 2005 Joanou began production on Gridiron Gang, based on the award-winning documentary that followed the first season of the inaugural football program at Camp Kilpatrick, a juvenile detention center in Los Angeles. The film starred Dwayne Johnson Jr. and opened number one in 2006 in both its theatrical run and its home video release. Joanou also directed Chris Tucker's first stand-up comedy special for Netflix in 2013, which was released in 2015.His most recent film, entitled The Veil, took Joanou into the horror/mystery genre for Blumhouse, Universal Pictures, and Netflix.\n"

His father, Tom Keadle, is a retired sales manager in the coal mining equipment business, and his mother, Jean Miller Yates is a retired schoolteacher.\nFrom Milton High School he went to the United States Air Force Academy and spent his freshman year there, majoring in chemistry. He received an honorable discharge from the US Air Force, and transferred to West Virginia University for his sophomore and junior years, continuing his undergraduate study of Chemistry.  He was granted early acceptance into the WVU School of Dentistry in 1985, and graduated with a Doctorate of Dental Surgery (DDS) in 1989.\nFollowing an unsuccessful campaign for Rowan County Commissioner in 1996, he became active in the Republican Party, serving as county finance chairman and then vice-chairman.  In 1998, he won a highly contested primary  to become the Republican nominee for Congress in the heavily Democratic 12th congressional district, winning 43% of the vote against incumbent Democrat Mel Watt, the highest percentage ever received by a Republican in that district.  In 2000, he won the Republican nomination for the heavily Democratic 23rd Senate district in the North Carolina General Assembly, and narrowly lost in the general election.\nHe moved to Iredell County in 2003 and ran successfully for County Commissioner there in 2008.  He was lauded by colleagues and the press as a strong and dominant conservative voice on the County Board, fighting for leaner budgets, transparent government, and always doing his homework. He did not seek re-election in 2010, and his fellow commissioners honored his service with a special presentation. The Mooresville Tribune reported that Commissioner \"Steve Johnson said he and Keadle may have disagreed on the issues, but he always respected Keadle for his honesty and integrity.\"In 2010, Keadle unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Congressman Patrick McHenry in the Republican primary.  He was subsequently named as a regional chairman for the national conservative action group, Americans for Prosperity, and traveled throughout south central North Carolina speaking with and on behalf of conservatives. Americans For Prosperity North Carolina executive director Dallas Woodhouse said of Keadle: \"As a commissioner and as a citizen, Scott has been a consistent voice for freemarkets, property rights, and the limited government principles that our members know will lead us to prosperity.\"In July 2011, anticipating favorable re-configuration of the congressional district lines, Keadle began a campaign to unseat Democrat Larry Kissell in North Carolina's 8th Congressional District in 2012.  The Hill newspaper has since rated Kissell \"the #1 most vulnerable incumbent in the country\", and National Review called Keadle \"a North Carolina Republican to watch\".Keadle's professional campaign organization includes noted advisor to Pat McCrory Jack Hawke as Lead Strategist, former NC GOP Executive Director Chris McClure, and Rick Perry advisor Walter Whetsell.\nThroughout his twenty years in North Carolina, Keadle has been active in community service organizations, including the CommunityCare Committee, Families for Kids, Stop Child Abuse Now, American Legion Post #185, the Boy Scouts, Civitans and Rotary.

Keaggy reflects on the incident:\n\nWe lived on a farm in Hubbard, Ohio which had a big water pump, and I was climbing up on it. As I was kneeling on top of the platform, it broke and the faucets came crashing down on my finger and cut it off. I can remember it very vividly\u2014as if it happened yesterday, and I can see my dad running down the hill, rescuing me, and taking me to the hospital. I can recall having a white cast and bandage; it was gigantic! They tried to sew it on, but it didn't take, so I grew up with nine fingers. As a young kid, I was embarrassed about it a lot, especially when I was beginning to get into guitar.\n\nInitially, it was not the guitar that attracted Keaggy to playing music. \"I asked my dad for a set of drums for my tenth birthday but he came home with a Sears Silvertone guitar.\"\nHis son Ian Keaggy was the bass player for the band Hot Chelle Rae, which had a Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2011.

In 1996, she moved to New Zealand and currently lives in Ranui, Auckland.\nKeakea is considered a 'mea taulima' artist, meaning that she creates her artwork with her hands, and is a promoter of Pasifika handcrafts.Keakea learned the practise of 'kolose' (crochet) from her mother, at the age of 12, and began making dresses and 'tiputa' (crochet tops). Keakea began making art in the 1950s, after moving to Niutao. Her first works included a belt, baskets, fans and trays. In the 1970s Keakea became active in Fakapotopotoga Fafine Tuvalu, an art group that taught and promoted the art practices of women from the various islands of Tuvalu. she travelled with the group to the Marshall Islands and learn the techniques of making 'fafetu', a star-shaped woven design.

He completed his MA and PhD at the University of Rochester, working under the supervision of American labour historian Herbert Gutman and Christopher Lasch on a dissertation that examined the Toronto working class during the transition to industrial capitalism. He would later publish this work in the Canadian Historical Association's Macdonald prize-winning book Toronto Workers Respond to Industrial Capitalism (1980). He followed this work with the co-authored (with Bryan Palmer), the CHA and AHA Corey prize-winning Dreaming of What Might Be: The Knights of Labor in Ontario (1982).\nIn 1976 Kealey helped found the journal Labour/Le Travail to provide an outlet for a new generation of scholars practising the \"new labour and working-class history,\" influenced by the work of E. P. Thompson and the Marxist tradition. He edited the journal from 1976 to 1997, when Bryan Palmer took over as editor. He returned briefly in 2016\u201317 as a co-editor, first with Bryan Palmer and then with Charles Smith. The journal, published by the Canadian Committee on Labour History, also produced books in the field under the CCLH imprint, many of which Kealey has edited. Kealey and his peers also co-operatively ran New Hogtown Press, a successor to the earlier Hogtown Press, publishing a number of books and left-wing pamphlets in the 1970s and 1980s in an attempt to provide a model of a non-profit socialist enterprise within a capitalist society.\n"

It was to be based at the disused Wye College in Kent, owned by Imperial College. The plan was supported by the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), whose 243 members include independent schools such as Eton College, Winchester College and St Paul's School, London. Kealey believed that complaints about impersonal teaching and oversized classes at many traditional universities mean there would be strong demand for higher education with staff-student ratios similar to that provided by independent secondary schools.\n\n\n== References ==\n"

He later completed a graduate diploma at the Institute of Chartered Accountants. While at university, he was elected to the UTS Student Representative Council and as the SRC Executive Member for the Haymarket Campus. Kean has been a member of the Liberal Party since 2001, and in 2008, he was elected vice-president of the NSW Young Liberals. During the 2003 State election campaign, Kean worked as an adviser for the Leader of the Opposition, John Brogden. He subsequently worked for Catherine Cusack MLC as an adviser while she was shadow minister for Juvenile Justice and Women.\nPrior to entering Parliament, Kean was briefly an accountant at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Aside from his brief time as an accountant, Kean's only professional experience has been as a political staffer.\nFollowing announcement of the retirement of the sitting member, Judy Hopwood, Kean contested pre-selection for the safe Liberal seat against Hornsby Mayor, Nick Berman, and Hornsby Councillor, Steve Russell. Kean won endorsement and Berman announced his decision to resign from the Liberal Party and run against Kean as an independent candidate at the 2011 State election. At the election, Kean was elected; however, the party suffered a swing of 3.5 points. Kean won the seat with 62.1 per cent of the two-party vote, with Berman being his main rival.\nKean used his inaugural speech to call on the government to spend as much money on suicide prevention campaigns as it does on road safety campaigns. His call for the $10 million campaign received support from Professor Ian Hickey and the Minister for Mental Health Kevin Humphries. He has hosted an annual Youth Forum in conjunction with Black Dog institute that aimed at educating students and teachers about issues relating to mental health; and has successfully campaigned for the construction of a new mental health inpatient facility in Hornsby.Following the resignation of Mike Baird as Premier, Gladys Berejiklian was elected as Liberal leader and sworn in as Premier. The Berejiklian ministry was subsequently formed, with Kean sworn in as the Minister for Innovation and Better Regulation, with effect from 30 January 2017. Following the 2019 state election, Kean was appointed as the Minister for Energy and Environment in the second Berejiklian ministry, with effect from 2 April 2019. Kean became embroiled in controversy soon after his appointment. In one of his first acts as Energy Minister, Kean appointed former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull inaugural chair of the government's net zero emissions advisory board. One week later Kean sacked Turnbull from the role, with Turnbull claiming Kean was pressured by right-wing media to do so.Matt Kean was involved in a sexting scandal in February 2018, texting Liberal MP Eleni Petinos to seek sexual intercourse while at the same time involved in a relationship with an adviser in Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's office, Caitlin Keage. Ms Keage subsequently shared the illicit text messages with the media, describing it as predatory behaviour by Kean. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian described Kean's conduct as extremely disappointing and Kean apologised in a media statement. This followed an earlier relationship scandal involving Kean in 2016, when a former partner said on Facebook, then retracted, that Kean had been \u201cscrewing\u201d one of Turnbull's advisers.Kean was sued for defamation by car dealer Bevin Clayton, who alleged Kean falsely described him as dishonest and untrustworthy in social media posts.Following the resignation of Berejiklian, Dominic Perrottet was elected as leader of the Liberal Party of New South Wales and sworn in as Premier. Kean was selected by Perrottet to succeed him as Treasurer of New South Wales, and was sworn in on 5 October 2021. In a December 2021 rearrangement of the Perrottet minister, Kean was appointed as Minister for Energy, and retained the portfolio of Treasurer.Kean has said that NSW, which currently generates 70% of its electricity from coal, can stop using coal-fired power by 2030, but environmental activists point to the continued approval of new coal mines in NSW as making this unlikely, and have argued that NSW will struggle to reach its target of net zero emissions by 2050.Kean has been described as a moderate Liberal, and is considered to be the leader of the moderate faction of the New South Wales Liberals.\n"

Smith. Despite not having the endorsement of Monmouth County Republican Chair William F. Dowd and the district's other Assemblyman Steve Corodemus, Kean won the special convention vote winning a majority of the vote (113 votes) on the first ballot defeating Long Branch councilman Anthony Giordano (81 votes) and former Asbury Park mayor Carl Williams (13 votes).

Palaia opted to retire at the end of his term. Kean sought election to the seat and defeated former professional football player and Assemblyman John Villapiano 63%-37%. During the first two years of his four-year Senate term, he served on the Legislative Services Commission, Labor, and Transportation Committees. In the next two years, he was a member of the Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee and the Transportation Committee.As a result of the 2011 legislative redistricting, Kean's hometown of Wall Township was placed into the 30th Legislative District setting up a potential primary election with fellow Republican Senator Robert Singer. Kean avoided such a fight by instead successfully running for election to the Assembly alongside David Rible (who was one of Kean's Assembly successors). In his current term in the Assembly, he is on the Consumer Affairs and Regulated Professions Committees.\n"

Keane <<<started her singing at a very young age>>>, <<<due to the influence of her musical aunts>>>. She made her first recording for Radio \u00c9ireann in 1958, at the age of five. This early start inevitably meant that Keane would have a career in music. <<<Her brother>>>, Se\u00e1n, <<<also went on to enjoy a successful music career>>>.\nKeane lived and worked in London for several years with Faulkner, before they moved to Ireland in the early 1980s. They worked on a series of film scores and programmes for the BBC and formed two successful bands, The Reel Union and Kinvara. During this period Keane recorded her first solo album, There Was a Maid in 1978. This was followed by two other releases, Broken Hearted I'll Wander (1979) and Farewell to Eirinn (1980), which gave credit to Faulkner. In the mid-1980s, she rejoined De Dannan and recorded the albums Anthem and Ballroom with them.\nKeane turned her attention, once again, to her solo career in 1988. It saw the release of the eponymous Dolores Keane album. Her follow-up album A Lion in a Cage, which was released in 1989, featured a song written by Faulkner called \"Lion in a Cage\", protesting the imprisonment of Nelson Mandela. It became Keane's first Irish number-one single, and she performed the hit at the celebration of his release. This exposure expanded Keane's reputation and popularity worldwide. A new facet was added to Dolores' career when she played the female lead in the Dublin production of Brendan Behan's The Hostage, a new translation by Niall T\u00f3ib\u00edn and Michael Scott, the opening night of which was attended by Mary Robinson, the President of Ireland at the time.\nIn 1992, Keane was among the many female Irish singers to lend their music to the record-smashing anthology A Woman's Heart. The album, which also featured Eleanor McEvoy, Mary Black, Frances Black, Sharon Shannon and Maura O'Connell, went on to become the biggest-selling album in Irish history. A Woman's Heart Vol. 2 was released in late 1994 and emulated its predecessor in album charts the world over.  Also in 1994, a solo album, entitled Solid Ground, was released on the Shanachie label (available on Dara Records) and received critical acclaim in Europe and America.\nIn August 1995, Keane was awarded the prestigious 'Fiddler's Green Hall of Fame' award in Rostrevor, County Down, for her \"significant contribution to the cause of Irish music and culture\". In that same year, she took to the stage in the Dublin production of JM Synge's Playboy of the Western World. Dolores contributed to the RT\u00c9/BBC television production Bringing It All Back Home (1991), a series of programmes illustrating the movement of Irish music to America. Keane was shown performing both in Nashville, Tennessee with musicians such as Emmylou Harris and Richard Thompson, and at home in Galway with her aunts Rita and Sarah.\nIn August 1997, Keane went to number one again in the Irish albums chart with a compilation album of her most loved songs. Another studio album was released by Keane in 1998, called Night Owl. It saw Keane returning to her traditional Irish roots and it did well in Europe and America. Despite a healthy solo career, Keane went on tour with De Dannan again in the late 1990s, where she played to packed audiences in venues such as Birmingham, Alabama and New York City.\nKeane has not released a solo album since 1998, stating that she wanted to take a hard-earned break after twenty-five years of relentless touring.\nKeane married musician John Faulkner, with whom she had worked on many occasions, in 1977. After a difficult pregnancy, Keane gave birth to their first child, Joseph. He was born with Bardet\u2013Biedl syndrome, which causes obesity and failing vision. Dolores and John's marriage ended in 1988.  Her current partner is Barry \"Bazza\" Farmer, with whom she had her second child, Tara, born in 1994. Keane put an end to recording and touring in the late 1990s, due to depression and alcoholism. She has received extensive treatment for these conditions. As of 2007, Keane lives outside Galway with her two children and her husband Barry. As of June 2014, Keane was given the all clear after developing cancer.\n"

            "early_life": "Born in London, Keane grew up in Dublin and later in Cork. His father was the Listowel-born actor, \u00c9amonn Keane. He attended three primary schools in Dublin: Scoil Bhride, a gaelscoil (Irish-language school), St. Mary's College and Terenure College, and, later, one primary school in Cork, St. Joseph's.In a 1999 interview with the Independent, Keane said that his gaelscoil education proved useful in later life: \"The grounding in the Irish language I had at Scoil Bhride has never left me. In a foreign country when I'm on the phone and don't wish people to understand what I'm saying, I speak Irish and no Serb listening in is going to crack the code.\"His secondary education was at Presentation Brothers College in Cork, where Keane says he was encouraged to join the school debating society, and where he won the Provincial Gold Medal for Public Speaking (on the subject of police brutality in Ireland). Today, Keane continues to draw on this experience acting as a public speaker, event chair and after dinner speaker.\nOn finishing school in 1979, Keane <<<started his career as a journalist>>> with the Limerick Leader. Subsequently, he <<<worked for>>> The Irish <<<Press>>>. Later, he moved into <<<broadcast journalism>>> with Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann (RT\u00c9).\nKeane joined the BBC in 1989 as Northern Ireland Correspondent, but in August 1990 he was appointed their Southern African Correspondent, having covered the region during the early 1980s. From 1990 to 1994 Keane's reports covered the township unrest in South Africa, the first multi-racial elections following the end of apartheid, and the genocide in Rwanda. In 1995 he was appointed Asia Correspondent based in Hong Kong and two years later, after the handover, he returned to be based in the BBC's World Affairs Unit in London.\nKeane was named as overall winner of the Amnesty International Press Awards in 1993 and won an Amnesty television prize in 1994 for his investigation of the Rwandan genocide, Journey into Darkness. He is the only journalist to have won both the Royal Television Society Journalist of the Year award and the Sony Radio Reporter of the Year in the same year \u2013 1994. He won The Voice of The Viewer award and a Listener Award for his 1996 BBC Radio 4 From Our Own Correspondent despatch Letter to Daniel, addressed to his newborn son, and a One World Television Award in 1999. He won a BAFTA award for his documentary on Rwanda, Valentina's Story. He has won the James Cameron Prize for war reporting, the Edward R. Murrow Award for foreign reporting, the Index on Censorship prize for journalistic integrity, and the 1995 Orwell Prize for his book Season of Blood. In May 2009 he won a Sony Gold Award for his Radio 4 series Taking A Stand. He also won a Peabody Award and an Emmy for his reporting as part of the BBC team covering the 2015 refugee crisis.\nIn the three-part documentary Forgotten Britain, serialised on the BBC in May 2000, Keane travelled across the country meeting people living on the edge in affluent societies.\nKeane was a patron of the UK-based development agency Msaada, which assisted survivors of the Rwandan genocide.\nIn 2010, he published his first history work Road of Bones: the Siege of Kohima 1944, an account of the epic battle which halted the Japanese invasion of India in 1944.\nOne of his projects is the five-part series The Story of Ireland, a 2011 documentary co-produced by BBC Northern Ireland and Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann.\nKeane has been awarded honorary degrees in literature from the University of Strathclyde, Bournemouth University and Staffordshire University. On 15 December 2011, he received an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Liverpool. Keane was appointed an OBE for services to journalism in the 1997 New Year's Honours list.\nIn April 2018 he was awarded the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize for Wounds.In November 2018, Keane provided the commentary for the Westminster Abbey service marking the centenary of the Armistice.The BBC revealed in January 2020 that Keane had suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for several years, and consequently moved out of his role as Africa editor in order to aid his recovery. In May 2022 he presented  the documentary Fergal Keane: Living with PTSD on BBC Two, in which he laid bare the impact of PTSD on himself and others like him. He explored how the disorder had led him to consider withdrawing from conflict reporting and investigated the latest scientific thinking behind the disorder and its treatment.\n"

            "early_life": "Keane was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the <<<son of cartoonist>>> Bil Keane, creator of The Family Circus, and Australian-born Thelma Keane (n\u00e9e Carne). He was raised in Paradise Valley, Arizona as a Roman Catholic.Keane's <<<interest in art developed from observing his father's work as a cartoonist>>>. (Keane's father based his Family Circus character of Billy on Glen's younger self.) To encourage Glen to draw, his father gave him a copy of Burne Hogarth's Dynamic Anatomy, and recommended he observe body forms and <<<practice creative approaches to life drawing>>>. \nAfter graduating from high school at Brophy College Preparatory in 1972, Keane applied to the California Institute of the Arts School of Art, rather than accepting a football scholarship to another college. His application was accidentally sent to the Program in Experimental Animation (then called Film Graphics), where he was mentored by Jules Engel.\nKeane left CalArts in 1974 and joined Disney the same year, where he spent three years working with veteran animator Ollie Johnston on the characters Bernard and Penny in The Rescuers. He subsequently animated Elliott the Dragon in Pete's Dragon, and the climactic bear showdown in The Fox and the Hound. \nIn 1982, inspired by the groundbreaking film Tron, Keane collaborated with animator John Lasseter (Toy Story, Toy Story 2) on a 30-second test scene of Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are, which was optioned for them by Disney executive Tom Wilhite. The test integrated traditional character animation and computer-generated backgrounds (Video on YouTube), and, like Tron, was a cooperation with MAGI. It was Disney's first experiment with digitally-drawn characters. Although the project was revolutionary (and became a predecessor to the famous ballroom scene in Beauty and the Beast), Disney declined to invest further in the featurette due to its cost.\nIn 1983, Keane left contract employment with Disney and worked as a freelance artist. He animated the character Professor Ratigan in Disney's The Great Mouse Detective; the \"Boys and Girls of Rock n' Roll\" and \"Getting Lucky\" in The Chipmunk Adventure; and the characters Fagin, Sykes, Jenny Foxworth and Georgette in Oliver & Company. \nHe became a lead character animator, one of the group of young animators mentored by \"Disney's Nine Old Men\". Keane animated some of Disney's most memorable characters in what has been called the \"New \"Golden Age\" of Disney Animation. He designed and animated the character of Ariel in the film The Little Mermaid (1989), and the eagle Marahute in The Rescuers Down Under. He was supervising animator for the title characters of the three Disney hit features Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and Pocahontas.\nWhile living with his family in Paris, France for three years, Keane completed work on Disney's 1999 Tarzan, for which he drew the eponymous character. He then returned to Disney's Burbank studio as the lead animator for John Silver in Treasure Planet. \nIn 2003, he began work as the director of Disney's CGI animated film Tangled (based on the Brothers Grimm story Rapunzel), released in November 2010, where Keane and his team strove to bring the style and warmth of traditional animation to computer animation. In October 2008, due to \"non-life threatening health issues\", Keane stepped back as director of Tangled, but remained the film's executive producer and an animating director.On March 23, 2012, Keane left Walt Disney Animation Studios after 37 years there. In a letter to his coworkers, he said, \"I owe so much to those great animators who mentored me \u2013 Eric Larson, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston \u2013 as well as to the many other wonderful people at Disney whom I have been fortunate to work with in the past nearly 38 years. I am convinced that animation really is the ultimate form of our time with endless new territories to explore. I can\u2019t resist its siren call to step out and discover them.\"He later said that one of the reasons he left Disney was his experience during the production of Tangled, which underwent several storyline and title changes. He felt that in a big studio like Disney, there were too many conflicting interests, with management pulling people \"in too many different directions\".In December 2013, it was announced that Keane joined Motorola's Advanced Technology and Projects Group to help its engineers create interactive hand-drawn animation. He released his first animated short, Duet, at the Google I/O Conference in San Francisco on June 25, 2014. It is the first hand-drawn cartoon made at 60 frames per second, and the third in a series of shorts, called the Spotlight Stories, designed to explore spatial awareness and the sensory inputs of a mobile device to create distinctive storytelling experiences. When Google sold its Motorola subsidiary in early 2014, Keane and  his group remained there.In 2015, it was revealed that Keane and 16 other prominent artists and filmmakers had been hired by the Paris Opera to work on their 3rd Stage project. \nKeane is the creator of the animated short Nephtali (a reference to Jacob's blessings and Psalm 42), on which he collaborated with choreographer and ballet dancer Marion Barbeau.In addition to his work as an animator, Keane has written and illustrated a series of children's books based on Bible parables, featuring the characters Adam Raccoon and King Aren the Lion.\nKeane directed the Chinese animated film Over the Moon, about a girl who builds a rocket and flies to the moon to meet a legendary moon goddess. Written by Audrey Wells, produced by Pearl Studio, and animated by Sony Pictures Imageworks, it was released on Netflix on October 23, 2020.At the 2018 Oscars, Keane shared the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film with Kobe Bryant for Dear Basketball, which was based on a poem Bryant wrote on his retirement.  On May 26, 2018 Keane received the 2017 Reuben Award for the Cartoonist of the Year  in his hometown of Philadelphia, PA.\nIn 1975, during the production of his debut film, Keane married Linda Hesselroth. They are the parents of design artist Claire Keane and computer graphics artist Max Keane.\nKeane has been cited among artists with aphantasia, a condition characterized by an inability to form mental images. He is a Christian.\n"

            "early_life": "Robert David Keane was born and raised in Tallaght, Dublin, the son of Anne and Robert Keane. He started his football career with local club Fettercairn before joining Dublin schoolboy team Crumlin United at the age of 10, where his talent was seen and recognised at an early age. He also played Gaelic football until he was 15, before giving it up to pursue a football career. Keane received offers from both Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers, but decided to go to the First Division side, judging that it would be harder to break into the first team at Liverpool. He moved to Wolverhampton four days before his 16th birthday in July 1996, joining their youth team.\nKeane was part of the so-called \"golden generation\" of Irish youth football of the late 1990s.Under the guidance of Brian Kerr, the unfancied Republic of Ireland won the UEFA U16 and U18 European championships in 1998, and Keane was part of the victorious U18 side in Cyprus. In 1999, he played at the World Youth Cup in Nigeria, where the Republic of Ireland reached the last 16 before going out on penalties to the hosts. His first Republic of Ireland cap came against the Czech Republic in Olomouc in March 1998. He scored his first senior international goals against Malta in October that year.Keane was selected by Mick McCarthy as part of the Republic of Ireland squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, scoring three goals in the Republic of Ireland's four games. Keane scored an injury-time equaliser against Germany in the group stage match as the Irish surprised many by holding the former champions to a 1\u20131 draw. This was the first of only three goals which Germany conceded in the tournament (the other two were scored in the final by Brazil's Ronaldo). In the Round of 16 match against Spain, he scored a last-minute penalty to force the game into extra-time and a penalty shootout after the Irish had gone a goal down early in the first half, but eventually lost 3\u20132 on penalties.Keane became the Republic of Ireland's leading goalscorer during a match against the Faroe Islands on 13 October 2004 when he scored his 22nd and 23rd goals. The first of these goals broke Niall Quinn's record of 21 goals.Although the Republic of Ireland failed to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Keane scored four goals in the Republic of Ireland's eight qualifying matches. Following Steve Staunton's appointment as Republic of Ireland manager, Keane was appointed captain. In their first game under Staunton, Keane scored the second goal in the 3\u20130 victory against Sweden at Lansdowne Road, and celebrated the final match at the Lansdowne Road stadium with a hat-trick on his 70th senior international appearance in a 5\u20130 defeat of San Marino on 15 November 2006. Giovanni Trapattoni, who took over from Staunton, maintained Keane as team captain starting in his first game in charge against Serbia on 24 May 2008 which ended in a 1\u20131 draw.As captain, Keane led the team to a second-place finish in the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign. He scored his 40th international goal against Cyprus, a header in the 83rd minute, which secured a 2\u20131 win for the Republic of Ireland. Along with Dimitar Berbatov, he topped the scoring chart in the qualifying group with 5 goals in 10 games. His 41st international goal came in the controversial 2010 World Cup play-off with France on 18 November 2009. This was his 26th goal in competitive (non-friendly) internationals.\nKeane won his 100th cap against Argentina in a 1\u20130 friendly defeat on 11 August 2010. This match was also the first international football match at the new Aviva Stadium. He scored his 45th international goal against Russia in October 2010. It was the first time the Republic of Ireland had lost a game in which Keane had scored. Previously, the Republic of Ireland had won 26 and drew 10 of the 36 games in which Keane had scored. He equalled Andy Townsend's record for most appearances as Republic of Ireland captain (40) on 26 March 2011 and also scored a goal in the process.\n\nKeane took part in the inaugural Nations Cup for the Republic of Ireland, which took place in February and May 2011. He ended the tournament as top scorer, despite not having played in their first game against Wales. Keane scored three goals in total, two against Northern Ireland in a 5\u20130 victory, and what proved to be the tournament's winning goal in a 1\u20130 victory over Scotland. The Republic of Ireland emerged from the competition victorious, having won all three of their games without conceding a goal.On 4 June 2011, Keane scored twice in a 2\u20130 away win against Macedonia in qualification for UEFA Euro 2012 to become the first Irish or British player to score more than 50 international goals. Following the game with Macedonia his total stood at 51 goals. He added another two goals in the Republic of Ireland's 4\u20130 play-off hammering of Estonia in Tallinn which effectively secured qualification for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine to bring his goal tally to 53.\n\nAfter a disappointing tournament in Poland, Keane brought his international tally to 54, with an 89th-minute penalty against Kazakhstan in the Republic of Ireland's opening World Cup 2014 qualification match. This left the score at 1\u20131 before Kevin Doyle's goal a minute later secured a winning start to the campaign. On 2 June 2013, Keane scored the third and fourth goals of the game, his 55th and 56th goals for the Republic of Ireland, against Georgia in a 4\u20130 win.On 7 June 2013, Keane played his 126th game for the Republic of Ireland and became the new record appearance holder, breaking Shay Given's previous record of 125 appearances. He also scored his second hat-trick of his international career in the same game against the Faroe Islands scoring his 57th, 58th and 59th goals in a 3\u20130 win for the Republic of Ireland. Keane scored his 60th international goal against Sweden on 6 September 2013, in a 2\u20131 loss. He went on to score his 61st and 62nd goals for the Republic of Ireland against Kazakhstan on 15 October 2013 in a 3\u20131 win and against Latvia a month later in a 3\u20130 victory, both games being played in Dublin.Keane missed his chance to score his 63rd goal against Costa Rica in Philadelphia on 6 June 2014 when he missed a penalty in a friendly game. He was the highest male international scorer among active players following Miroslav Klose's retirement in 2014. On 11 October 2014, he scored his third international hat-trick, his 63rd, 64th and 65th goals, in a 7\u20130 European qualifying win against Gibraltar at Aviva Stadium. The treble concluded with a penalty in the 18th minute. This took him to a record 21 goals in European Championship qualifiers, surpassing the 20 by Turkey's Hakan \u015e\u00fck\u00fcr. He would later extend his tally to 23 goals, although the record was broken by Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo on 10 September 2019.Keane was selected in manager Martin O'Neill's 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016 in what would be his final major tournament appearance for the Republic of Ireland. However, he was restricted to a bench role and only played a total of 23 minutes against Sweden and Belgium respectively.On 24 August 2016, Keane announced his retirement from international football. His last match for the Republic of Ireland was a friendly against Oman on 31 August 2016 at Aviva Stadium. The Republic of Ireland emerged victorious 4\u20130 and Keane signed off with a goal to take him level with German great Gerd M\u00fcller on 68 international goals. He received a rousing ovation from the assembled crowd when he was substituted in the 57th minute. Keane was also given a guard of honour from his Republic of Ireland teammates after the match had finished and he left the pitch with his two sons to rapturous applause from the home fans.\nIn March 2018, Keane was appointed player-manager of ATK after Sheringham and his replacement Ashley Westwood were sacked with ATK finishing outside the play-offs. He scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win over NorthEast United on his managerial debut, enough to save them from last place. After contesting the final three matches as player-manager, Keane decided to leave the club at the end of the season.\nIn November 2018, Keane agreed to act as the assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland national team, under the management of newly-appointed Mick McCarthy.In June 2019, he accepted the dual roles of assistant manager of Middlesbrough in the Championship and the Republic of Ireland national team. His former teammate Jonathan Woodgate, who had been appointed the manager of the Teesside-based club, offered him the role as part of a refurbished coaching team. On 23 June 2020, Keane left his role as assistant manager after his one-year contract came to an end during the COVID pandemic.\nKeane has completed UEFA coaching qualifications, receiving the UEFA Pro Licence in 2020.In May 2023, he joined the coaching staff of Leeds United following the appointment of Sam Allardyce as manager.\nKeane married Xpos\u00e9 presenter  and former Miss Ireland contestant Claudine Palmer in Ballybrack on 7 June 2008.

            "early_life": "Roy Maurice Keane was born into a working class family in the Ballinderry Park area of Cork's Mayfield suburb on 10 August 1971. His father Maurice took work wherever he could find; this included jobs at a local knitwear company and at Murphy's Irish Stout brewery, among others. His family was keen on sport, especially football, and many of his relatives had played for junior Cork clubs such as Rockmount. Keane took up boxing at age nine and trained for several years, winning all of his four bouts in the novice league. During this period, he was developing as a much more promising footballer at Rockmount, and his potential was highlighted when he was voted \"Player of the Year\" in his first season. Many of his teammates were offered trials abroad with English football teams, but Keane was not. He supported Celtic and Tottenham Hotspur as a child, citing Liam Brady and Glenn Hoddle as his favourite players, but Manchester United player Bryan Robson later became the footballer he most admired.\nKeane was part of the squad that participated in the 1988 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship although he did not play. He was man of the match for the Republic of Ireland national under-19 team when they beat hosts Hungary in the 1990 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship to qualify for the 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship.When called up for his first game at the international level, an under-21s match against Turkey in 1991, Keane took an immediate dislike to the organisation and preparation surrounding the Irish team, later describing the set-up as \"a bit of a joke\". He would continue to hold this view throughout the remainder of his time spent with the national team, which led to numerous confrontations with the Irish management. Keane declared his unavailability to travel with the Irish squad to Algeria, but was surprised when manager Jack Charlton told him that he would never play for Ireland again if he refused to join up with his compatriots. Despite this threat, Keane chose to stay at home on the insistence of Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough, and was pleased when a year later he was called up to the Irish squad for a friendly at Lansdowne Road. After more appearances, he grew to disapprove of Charlton's style of football, which relied less on the players' skill and more on continuous pressing and direct play. Tensions between the two men peaked during a pre-season tournament in the United States when Charlton berated Keane for returning home late after a drinking session with Steve Staunton.Keane was included in the Republic of Ireland senior squad for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the U.S. and played in every game, including a famous 1\u20130 victory over tournament favourites and eventual runners-up Italy. Despite a second-round exit at the hands of the Netherlands, the tournament was considered a success for the Irish team, and Keane was named the best player of Ireland's campaign. Keane, however, was reluctant to join the post-tournament celebrations, later claiming that, as far as he was concerned, Ireland's World Cup was a disappointment: \"There was nothing to celebrate. We achieved little.\"Keane missed crucial matches during the 1998 World Cup qualification matches due to a severe knee injury but came back to captain the team to within a whisker of qualification for UEFA Euro 2000, losing to Turkey in a play-off. Ireland secured qualification for the 2002 World Cup under new manager Mick McCarthy, greatly assisted by several match-winning performances from Keane. In the process of qualification, Ireland went undefeated, both home and away, against international football heavyweights Portugal and the Netherlands, famously beating the latter 1\u20130 at Lansdowne Road.\nKeane's former manager Sir Alex Ferguson had previously said that he wanted Keane to succeed him as Manchester United coach when he retired. In the wake of Keane's acrimonious departure from the club, however, Ferguson became evasive regarding Keane's prospects as a manager: \"Young managers come along and people say this one will be England manager or boss of this club, but two years later they're not there. It's not an easy environment to come into, I wouldn't forecast anything.\"\n"

She was a founder member of the non-profit women\u2019s film distribution organization Circles - Women in Distribution. Keane also curated and programmed exhibitions and screenings including The New Pluralism exhibition at the Tate Gallery, with Michael O'Pray, in 1985.\nKeane has been an important influence on successive generations of artists in the UK as a teacher at Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design, London, where she was Lecturer in Film & Video since 1982 and Research Fellow from 2003 to 2012. According to Malcolm Le Grice, \"During the 1970s and \u201980s, the teaching of women artists \u2013 including Tina Keane, Anna Thew, Anne Tallentire, Joanna Greenhill and Pam Skelton \u2013was one of Saint Martins\u2019 major contributions to art education. Their influence helped create a lasting shift in the gender profile in British art, and Saint Martins in general maintained a committed concern for gender, ethnicity and sexual politics throughout the Thatcher years.\u201d Notable students who were mentored by Keane include Sandra Lahire, Sarah Turner and Isaac Julien.\nHer 1978 multimedia work, She, presented at the Hayward Gallery, London, in 1978 was an early example of performance that incorporated live video and slide projections. Transparencies of neon signs, poetry and images of shop windows featuring mannequins were projected on a wall before which Keane performed, while video of the performance played on monitors surmounted with neon texts. Keane has said that the work brought into play \"the actual and the recorded, the shop dummy, and the person, the illusion and the reality\"Transposition, first presented at the Museum of Modern Art, Vienna, in 1992, used the body as a screen with video projected onto the naked backs of men as they glide sideways standing on a travelator. Keane subsequently re-edited the piece into a double screen video installation for the inaugural Tanks programme at Tate Modern, London, in 2012.In 2015, Keane was one of the recipients of the 21st annual Paul Hamlyn Foundation Awards for Artists, the largest individual awards made to visual artists and composers in the UK. Her pioneering, poetic film, 'Faded Wallpaper', was acquired by Tate in 2018.\n\n\n== References ==\n"

            "early_life": "Kearney was born and grew up in Iowa City, Iowa. Her <<<mother played flute>>>. She started her <<<journey with music>>> in the Lutheran Church's Cherub <<<choir>>>. Kearney <<<took piano lessons at the age of 5 and began playing bass>>> in the 4th grade. She listened to her parent's rock and roll records from the 1960's and gained an appreciation of the Beatles' music. In high school, she <<<played in the school orchestras and jazz bands>>> and was in a rock and roll band. At 13, Kearney and her band, Metro Pilot, won a songwriting contest for a song called \"Live\" about the dangers of tobacco, where the prize was to perform the song in front of a live audience including keynote speaker and former United States Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. Bridget fronted the band playing electric bass and singing lead vocals.Recalling playing bass in the fourth grade, Kearney said, \"I just thought I would go with the bass that year and switch instruments the next year, but after I started playing bass and got to know it, I decided to stay with it. The cool thing is that if you\u2019re a bass player, there\u2019s always demand. There were points at which I was in 12 different bands.\" In interviews she recalls how her jazz band director in high school, Rich Medd, always made class fun saying, \"I was always excited to go to jazz band rehearsal and that is one of the reasons I\u2019m still playing music.\" Lake Street Dive's early 2023 \"Gather Round Sounds\" concert tour found Kearney returning for a sold-out show at Hancher Auditorium on January 24, 2023 with Mr. Medd and other local music educators joining as the horn section.Already an accomplished and devoted bass player at a young age, Kearney played electric bass through junior high school, after which she moved to jazz music and switched to an upright or double bass until age 35 when Kearney acquired a number of electric bass guitars and other gear which expanded her sound.Kearney's knowledge, skills and innate capacity for creativity took her to a much higher musical level while studying with Mark Urness, a versatile bassist, composer, and educator in Iowa City at the time who later moved to teaching at Lawrence University in Wisconsin. Her early bass influences were Paul Chambers, Charles Mingus and Charlie Haden.In college Kearney double majored, studying jazz bass at the New England Conservatory of Music and English at Tufts University. As a sophomore, she played with two bands she helped found: Joy Kills Sorrow and Lake Street Dive.\nKearney likes to play tennis and run to stay fit and raise money for her favorite charities. She often seeks adventure on the road, like bungee jumping in New Zealand, and is a master of chipology. Her first job, during college, was selling souvenirs at Fenway Park. She once held the one-game record for selling the most (105) foam fingers during a Boston Red Sox game and refers to this early career as her \"fall-back, in case the music thing doesn't work out.\"\n"

In 1999, at age 24, he was asked to join Swedish B3 organ player Paul Wagnberg's Organ Unit trio. This position established Kjekstad as one of the top jazz guitar players in Norway, and made him grow a good reputation, leading to all kinds of other gigs. In 2000 he recorded his unofficial first CD \u201cPresenting Frode Kjekstad\u201d, with Paul Wagnberg (B3) and B\u00f8rre Dalhaug (drums). This CD got great reviews in USA and Italy: \u201cThis young genius has a perfect sense of time and rhythm\u201d (Frank Forte, Just Jazz Guitar 2001).\nAfter meeting New York based jazz guitarist Randy Johnston in the 1990s, he got the possibility to record his first official solo album \u201cNew York Time\u201d in February 2002. This album was recorded in New York with Dr. Lonnie Smith and drummer Byron Landham, and with saxophonist Eric Alexander on three tunes. The band set a new record in the studio for making an album in shortest time (about 3 hours), with a lot of extra time left for socializing and sharing stories from Lonnie Smith's career. The CD \u201cNew York Time\u201d, released in 2004, opened up doors all over the world, and led to many new collaborations and journeys. In 2003 Kjekstad also married jazz singer Aina Frid\u00e9n, and had three kids.\nIn 2008 Kjekstad recorded a trio album with Norwegian super bass player Per Mathisen and drummer Ole Morten Summer, that was never released, due to too much work, and financial problems. Some of these tunes can be found on YouTube.\nIn 2012 Kjekstad hooked up with Italians drummer Enzo Zirilli and organist Alberto Marsico. They recorded the album \u201cFrode Kjekstad: The Italian Job\u201d and played gigs around Europe.\nAfter doing a tour with old friend sax player Eric Alexander in 2013, Kjekstad was invited to play some gigs at the club Smoke in New York with the legendary organ quartet \u201cMike LeDonne\u00b4s Groover Quartet\u201d featuring Eric Alexander, B3 player Mike LeDonne and drummer Joe Farnsworth. Regular guitarist Peter Bernstein was out of town. Kjekstad also booked a studio to make a new CD with this band. The result was \u201cFrode Kjekstad: A Piece Of The Apple\u201d, released in 2017.\nIn October 2019 Kjekstad recorded a new trio album in Norway, featuring Norwegian bass player Frode Berg and the drummer Magnus Sefaniassen Eide. The CD is called \u201cFrode Kjekstad: In Essence\u201d, and will be released in December 2019.\nGuitars: \nKjekstad bought a blond 1983 Gibson ES-175D with mahogany body in 1992, and played only this guitar until 2016. In 2016 he got a 1974 Gibson Johnny Smith, which now is his main instrument.\n"

He performed as an understudy in a 1964 Broadway production of Incident at Vichy, and the following year had a supporting role in a Broadway production of Tartuffe. From late 1965 through the spring of 1966, he starred on Broadway as Fray Marcos de Nizza in The Royal Hunt of the Sun.He made his film debut in The Sex Perils of Paulette (1965) before appearing as a murderer in the semi-biographical crime film The Honeymoon Killers (1970).

From 1974\u20131976, Lo Bianco played a lead role in six episodes of Joseph Wambaugh's anthology television series Police Story in the mid-1970s, four times alongside Don Meredith. He also appeared in several Italian films, including the Lee Van Cleef-starring crime comedy Mean Frank and Crazy Tony (1973).\nIn 1975, Lo Bianco won an Obie award for his off-Broadway performance as Duke Bronkowski in the baseball-themed play Yanks-3, Detroit-0, Top of the Seventh.

Lo Bianco purchased the rights to the play from Shyre's estate and has rewritten it a few times.

His parents immigrated to the Netherlands in 1937, and Lo-A-Njoe was born in Amsterdam later that year. He lived through the Second World War as a young child. From 1953 to 1958, Lo-A-Njoe <<<studied fine art and painting>>> at the Amsterdam Kunstnijverheidsschool (School of Applied Arts), a predecessor to the Gerrit Rietveld Academie.\nIn 1958, Lo-A-Njoe received the Koninklijke Subsidie voor de Vrije Schilderkunst (Royal Subsidy for Fine Art Painting) to encourage young promising artists. Later that year, he had his first exhibition at Caf\u00e9 Eijlders: a large venue at the Leidseplein in Amsterdam, which is famous for its artistic ambiance and clientele.\nDuring the 1960s and 70s, he made many study trips in Europe and lived in the United States and Suriname. He also travelled to India, Morocco, Mexico and the Caribbean for inspiration.\nLo-A-Njoe's art is present in museums worldwide: the Municipal Museum of Mexico City; Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam; Cobra Museum for Modern Art in Amstelveen; Kunstmuseum Den Haag in The Hague; Surinaams Museum in Paramaribo; het Cura\u00e7aosch Museum in the Dutch Caribbean; the state art collection of the Netherlands (Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed); among others.\nBesides having a presence in museums, Lo-A-Njoe's art can be found in many private  collections worldwide and is regularly put up for auction at prestigious auction houses such as AAG (Arts & Antiques Group) or Christie's and Sotheby's.\nLo-A-Njoe also works as a commissioned artist for private and public commissions. In Amsterdam, two of his commissioned artworks can be seen in public space. He designed a plaque to commemorate Surinamese nationalist and WWII resistance fighter Anton de Kom, who died in a concentration camp. The plaque was unveiled by Lo-A-Njoe on 24 November 1990 at the Anton de Kom square in Amsterdam. In 1991, a monument was unveiled in memory of the victims of Surinam Airways Flight 764, which crashed on 7 June 1989 during en route to Paramaribo-Zanderij International Airport, killing 176 of the 187 on board, making it the deadliest aviation disaster in Suriname's history. In 2008, Lo-A-Njoe celebrated his 70th birthday and his 50th anniversary as an artist.

A new personal website features his motto: 'The beauty of a painting is that it makes no sound.' Lo-A-Njoe states that, according to him, 'Creating bears witness to my presence on Earth.'

            "early_life": "In 1998, Lo signed with Sony Music Hong Kong to launch a career as a solo artist. Her first release under Sony was the EP Don't Have to be...Too Perfect (\u4e0d\u9700\u8981...\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5f97\u53ef\u6015) which contained the breakthrough radio-hit \"Trash\" (\u5783\u573e), considered one of her signature songs. Although \"Trash\" was a fairly mainstream ballad, the rest of the EP showed a continuity with her indie past. Lo would later ditch Keith Chan and Wyman Wong who had a dominant presence on the EP to work with entirely different songwriters and lyricists for her debut album. Released in late 1998, Lo's first full-length solo album was titled Miao, which referred to her love of cats and how \"they listen while people sometimes don't.\"Miao was apparently released to \"more than disappointing\" album sales and low radio airplay, with producer Kubert Leung remarking that the public had \"failed to grasp the concept of the album.\"Lo's second album, Getting Closer to Candy Lo (\u8cbc\u8fd1\u76e7\u5de7\u97f3) (1999), represented a more conscious attempt to connect with a mainstream audience, while retaining a sense of the unique individualism found in Miao. The album continued to set Lo's music apart from the mainstream. It contained five of her compositions, including the single \"Regeneration,\" (\u65b0\u9673\u4ee3\u8b1d) which was influenced by 70's art rock. Upon release, the album garnered her some comparisons as \"Hong Kong's Faith Yang\". Art direction for the album was done by William Chang.\nA substantially more commercial direction was signalled by the release of 2002's Appreciating the Taste of Life (\u8cde\u5473\u4eba\u9593), which gave Lo her first-ever smash hit, \"Please Break Up\" (\u597d\u5fc3\u5206\u624b). The song topped the charts and won her year-end awards at all four of Hong Kong's major radio and TV stations, making it a career highlight for Lo. A duet version of the song was recorded with Taiwan singer Leehom Wang to accompany the second edition of the album. The song remains one of the most frequently requested songs at Hong Kong karaoke bars to this day.\nIn May 2003, Lo held her first stadium concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum, True Music 1st Flight Live 2003, performing for two nights. This coincided with the release of the album Candy's Airline (\u7cd6\u679c\u822a\u7a7a), which spawned one of her biggest hits, \"Love Triangle\" (\u4e09\u89d2\u8a8c), and was followed up later in the year by Flower Talk (\u82b1\u8a00.\u5de7\u8a9e) which contained a further hit, \"Fall & Blossom\" (\u843d\u5730\u958b\u82b1).\nAfter a string of radio-friendly albums, Lo released her final album with Sony, Evolution Theory (\u5929\u6f14\u8ad6) in 2005, which returned to her alternative musical roots and is one of her most uncompromising albums to date. Like Flower Talk which preceded it, the album contains lyrics which deal with Buddhist themes.\nLo married Sammy So, lead singer of the band Kolor, in April 2013.\n"

            "early_life": "Lo was born in Hong Kong in 1963. His <<<mother taught music>>> and his father, Wai-hoi Lo, who immigrated from Chaozhou to Hong Kong in 1946, was a psychiatrist and the former head of Castle Peak Hospital. He also has a younger brother.Lo attended St Joseph's College for primary and secondary schools. After secondary school, he was accepted by Stanford University for <<<electrical engineering>>> and by the University of Hong Kong <<<and University>>> of Cambridge <<<for medicine>>>. He <<<selected medicine and decided to study abroad>>>. In 1983, at the age of 20, Lo arrived at Cambridge, where he spent 2 years to <<<complete preclinical medical training and a BA degree>>>, and <<<studied genetic cloning>>> in his third.In 1986, he moved to the University of Oxford for his clinical training, in part, he claimed, thanks to Christopher Wren's architectural works at Oxford. Lo was at Christ Church College during this period.He first <<<completed>>> his <<<BM BCh>>> in 1989, and then a DPhil (during which he was at Hertford College) in 1994 and DM in 2001, all at Oxford. He <<<was also a junior research fellow in natural sciences>>> at Hertford College between 1990 and 1993, and the Wellcome Career Development Fellow in Clinical Medicine from 1993 to 1994.\nLo <<<began his research career studying polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a molecular biological technique for rapidly generating millions of copies of a desired DNA sequence>>>. He <<<first heard about the technique at a lecture>>> by John Bell, now Regius Professor of Medicine, at Oxford, <<<and asked to learn the technique>>> from Bell. Working with Kenneth Anthony Fleming, his future PhD advisor, Lo found the relatively new technique generated a lot of false positives due to contamination.Lo then wondered if fetal DNA was detectable in mother's blood. Using PCR, he detected the Y chromosome in a mother bearing a baby boy. During his PhD, Lo wanted to develop his research into prenatal diagnostic test, using fetal DNA from fetal cells in the mother's blood. This, however, was stymied by a number of factors, including low concentration of fetal cells, high false positive rate and the persistence of fetal cells after giving birth.After obtaining his PhD, Lo became a lecturer in clinical biochemistry and a fellow at Green College, University of Oxford (now part of Green Templeton College). He was also an honorary consultant chemical pathologist at John Radcliffe Hospital, the major teaching hospital for Oxford.In 1997, again using the Y chromosome as a marker in mothers bearing baby boys, Lo reported the presence of cell-free fetal DNA in most of the test subjects. This was after he read that circulating tumor DNA were detectable in cancer patients' blood plasma and switched strategy to search for cell-free fetal DNA in mother's blood.Lo, who by the time was married, returned to Hong Kong the same year with his wife, as the city was preparing its handing back to China. He became a senior lecturer in the Department of Chemical Pathology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in January 1997. In an interview years later, he called this discovery was like \"finding your car's engine somewhere other than under the bonnet.\"One of the first disorders for which Lo developed non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA was Rh disease, a type of anaemia that occurs when the foetus is Rh-positive but the mother is Rh-negative. Separately, Lo also detected fetal RNA in mother's blood, which indicated what genes were expressed. He then sought novel methods to isolate fetal DNA from mother's blood, which in 2002 came in the form of difference in DNA methylation between the mother and foetus.Lo's research into non-invasive prenatal testing was interrupted in 2003 by the SARS outbreak. An infected patient was treated at the Prince of Wales Hospital, the teaching hospital for CUHK Faculty of Medicine, turning the hospital into one of the epicenters in Hong Kong. His group was one of the first to sequence the SARS virus and to discover the existence of multiple viral strains.Lo returned to studying detection of cell-free fetal DNA after the SARS outbreak. In 2008, he reported the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS), which has a much higher throughput than traditional PCR and was a relatively new technology at the time. When used to detect Down syndrome, which is caused by an extra chromosome 21, this method was later shown to have a 100% sensitivity and a nearly 98% specificity, prompting its introduction into clinics in 2011.The next year, while watching a Harry Potter movie in 3D, the flying \"H\" reminded him of 2 homologous chromosomes and gave him an idea on how to sequence the fetal genome: to separately sequence the 2 halves of DNA that the foetus inherited from the father and the mother. For the father's half, they searched for DNA sequences present only in the father but not the mother; for the mother's half, they counted the DNA sequences from the mother to deduce the sequences inherited by the foetus, which would be found in excess in the mother's blood plasma. This discovery created a non-invasive method to detect fetal mutations. In 2013, his group showed that the fetal epigenome could also be determined from mother's blood plasma.Apart from non-invasive prenatal testing, Lo started investigating cancer diagnosis, profiling and prognosis from circulating tumor DNA using NGS in 2012, when he reported the genetic profiling of cancer in patients' blood plasma.As of October 2021, Lo is an associate editor of Clinical Chemistry.Lo is the co-founder of 2 biotechnology companies, both established in 2014. Using funding from the venture capital firm Decheng Capital, he co-founded Cirina with his longtime CUHK collaborators Rossa Chiu and Allen Chan. The company focuses on cancer detection with circulating tumor DNA. The company was acquired by GRAIL in 2017, which, in turn, was acquired by Illumina in 2021. The 3 of them also co-founded Xcelom, which commercialised their research in non-invasive prenatal testing.In the 2021 Hong Kong legislative election, Lo was a registered elector in the functional constituency of Technology and Innovation and the geographical constituency of Kowloon West. The State Key Laboratory of Translational Oncology at CUHK, with which he is affiliated, is also a corporate elector (an elector that is a legal entity, as opposed to a natural person) at the same functional constituency. As Lo is also a member of the Election Committee of Hong Kong, making him eligible to vote in the Election Committee constituency, he was one of the 41 voters who held 4 votes and whose voting power would be approximately 7,215 times of an ordinary citizen.\nLo is married to Alice Siu Ling Wong. They met each other while Lo was pursuing his DPhil at the University of Oxford, where Wong was completing her DPhil in semiconductor physics. They got married in 1994.As of 2016, Wong is an associate professor and the head of the formerly Division of Mathematics and Science Education, Faculty of Education at the University of Hong Kong. She is no longer on the faculty list as of 2021.It was reported in 2021 that Lo bought a flat at The Masterpiece in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong for HKD$210 million.Lo is one of the initiators of the Hong Kong Coalition, co-founded by two former Chief Executives of Hong Kong Tung Chee-hwa and Leung Chun-ying.\n\n\n== References ==\n"

Delany, Sarah Schulman and David Groff.She resides in Massachusetts with her wife, Amy Lovell.\nLo <<<began writing for the culture blog>>> AfterEllen in 2003, and at one point served as the managing editor.Her first novel, Ash, was published by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers in 2009. Ash was a finalist for the William C. Morris Award, the Andre Norton Award for YA Fantasy and Science Fiction, the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award, and the Lambda Literary Award. Her second book, Huntress, was published by Little, Brown in 2011. It is set in the same fantasy world as Ash, which mixes East Asian and European influences; it too was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award finalist and for the 2012 Gaylactic Spectrum Award for Best Novel, as well as being judged a Best Book for Young Adults by the American Library Association. Her third book, Adaptation, was published in 2012. Reviewers at Kirkus Reviews and elsewhere have compared it favorably to the television program The X-Files. The X-Files was also the subject of Lo's graduate research at Stanford. A sequel to Adaptation, titled Inheritance, was published in 2013.A stand-alone thriller novel, A Line in the Dark, was published in 2017 and was named a Best Book of the Year by Kirkus, Vulture, and Chicago Public Library.In 2021, Lo released the book Last Night at the Telegraph Club, following a teenaged American-born Chinese woman coming to terms with her homosexuality during the McCarthy Red Scare in 1950s San Francisco, adapted from a short story she wrote for the 2018 anthology All Out: The No-Longer-Secret Stories Of Queer Teens Throughout The Ages. She has since written Notes from the Telegraph Club, a series of blogposts about her research for the novel, and described that she chose to use Chinese characters with footnote translations for when the characters are speaking Chinese to each other, partly because the romanization of Chinese was not yet standardized in the 1950s and \"Romanized Chinese of the 1950s was for the benefit of non-Chinese Westerners, mostly white people\" and partly to make clear the sense of insider versus outsider culture. Last Night at the Telegraph Club was well received, with Kirkus opening their review with \"Finally, the intersectional, lesbian, historical teen novel so many readers have been waiting for\" and Joanne Zou writing for Farrago that it \"struck a very personal chord with me. It is a book full of hope and love and community and gay people, some of my favourite elements in storytelling. I am glad this book exists and it made me glad that I exist.\" In May 2021, it was announced that Last Night at the Telegraph Club had earned Lo another ALA Best Fiction for Young Adults nomination. In November 2021 her YA Novel, Last Night at the Telegraph Club was awarded the National Book Award for Young People's Literature.Lo followed up Last Night at the Telegraph Club with a standalone companion novel called A Scatter of Light, which was published on October 4, 2022. A coming-of-age story, it is set in 2013, during the time same-sex marriage is legalized in California, a topic which is used to connect the two novels.\n"

The lobby of this Lo family residence has pair of royal plaques bestowed by Emperor of the Qing dynasty.\nDuring the two major wars in China (the First and Second Sino-Japanese Wars), everything was destroyed. Owing to this, Lo family members temporarily stayed with the younger brother of Yip Man, Yip Ten, in his large mansion in Mulberry Garden. After the war, the Lo family moved back to Hong Kong.\nLo was encouraged by Yip Man to teach in Taiwan before he moved to Taiwan in the 1960s. When Lo first moved to Taiwan, he <<<underwent special military academy training>>>. After graduation, Lo was appointed to work at the Ministry of National Defense in Taiwan. In 1975, he retired as a Major and opened his Wing Chun Kung Fu school in Neihu, Taipei, Taiwan. Immediately after <<<opening the school>>>, he had students named Daniel Duby (from Reunion) and James (from Madagascar). These students were the first foreign disciples to participate in the \"Bai Si Lai\" (Ceremony to honor the Sifu and to be accepted as an official disciple) in the Taiwanese wushu community.\nIn 1990, due to a speech given by Lo, the Taiwan Special Police Force First Corps leader Dr. Lu, who recognized the value of Lo's talent, appointed him to be a Taiwan Special Police Force instructor.\nIn 1992, when the Republic of China-Taiwan started its first SWAT team, Lo was appointed to be the first SWAT team head instructor.\nIn 1993, Dr. Lu from the Special Police Force got promoted to the principal of the Taiwan Police College. Lo then joined him at the Police College and continued teach and train future police officers and training instructors. Lo also helped the Police College by authoring the text book \u201cPolice Kung Fu\u201d, which focuses on hand-to-hand combat techniques. This book has been translated to English and sold in the US and later translated to Russian as well.\nAt this time, director of Taiwan National Security Bureau had appointed Lo to teach Taiwan CIA hand-to-hand combat training, and also to write Bureau of Investigation teaching materials. Lo worked as training instructor for the Taiwan National Security Bureau 10 years. Lo also helped the Taiwan Judicial Yuan (Department) by authoring material for the Judicial police hand book and other training material, as well as serving as Taiwan Judicial Yuan training instructor.\nLo's position at the Police College, beginning with the term of Principle Dr. Lu, and continuing through the term of 5 other principals, lasted 18 years. Every now and then, he is invited back to give special training lessons.\n"

She won the silver award for Most Promising Newcomer at the 1995 Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation.However, with personnel issues at Warner Music in 1996, her second album was delayed indefinitely.  It was finally released in 1997 with little promotion and was a commercial failure. She was then dropped by Warner Music Hong Kong.  Subsequently, Lo asked to be released from her management contract at Music Sense. However, a clause in the contract restricted her from appearing in any public performances for three years and forced her into hiatus. At this time, her radio DJ friends invited her to work at Radio Television Hong Kong behind the scenes as a receptionist and secretary until her contract restriction was over.  During this 3-year hiatus, Lo admitted to suffering from depression as a result of the turmoil.\nIn 2010, Lo appeared in an episode of the singing competition The Voice when contestant Penny Chan asked her to perform a duet with him during a round of competition.  He chose her power ballad signature song, \"\u6311\u6230\u8005 The Challenger\".  Her flawless rendition of the song garnered universal praise.  Judge Anthony Lun mentioned during his critique, \"I wish there are more singers in Hong Kong like Mimi.\"  Upon hearing this, Lo broke into tears. Lo then went on to thank the contestant for choosing her and her song as no one has sung her songs in 15 years.  Host Sammy Leung then asked the audience to go pick Lo's songs to sing at karaoke.\nHer performance on the show sparked public interest in her past singing career on Hong Kong's media forums.  Upon airing of the episode, \"\u6311\u6230\u8005 The Challenger\" hit number six on popular Hong Kong karaoke chain KKBox's song chart on 1 July 2010. Lo suddenly found herself in the spotlight once again with media attention and newfound fans to her music.

            "early_life": "Lo was a former CHIJ Katong Convent student. Lo was dubbed the \"Sticker Lady\" for their pasting of stickers utilising Singlish phrases, such as Press Until Shiok and Anyhow Paste Kena Fine, at traffic-light junctions and public spaces. In 2012, Lo was arrested for spray painting the words \"My Grandfather Road\" on Maxwell Road and Robinson Road. Their arrest by the police for vandalism sparked an outcry over their work, prompting debates over whether it could be seen as a work of art or vandalism. They were later charged for mischief and sentenced to 240 hours of community service in 2013.\nIn 2009, Lo founded online magazine RCGNTN as a way to recognise local artists and talent. They were also a content curator for the National Gallery Singapore's Canvas project.In 2012, Lo was arrested for vandalism for pasting satirical stickers on traffic light buttons such as Press Once Can Already and Press Until Shiok as well as spray painting the words My Grandfather Road on several roads in the Central Business District. They were motivated to \"take back the streets to make Singapore feel like Singapore again\", a response to the fast-changing cityscape of the city. Netizens took to the internet to weigh in their views and started a petition to lessen their sentence, in the process birthing the identity \"sticker lady\". Lo was then charged in 2013 for mischief instead of vandalism which carried a heavier sentence.\nThey then proceeded to work with numerous brands and agencies, notably Sentosa's The People's Republic showing satirical signs currently on display on the island. Lo made their debut at Affordable Art Fair in 2013 with a series of Yakult-inspired paintings and art collectibles that served as a statement on the commodification of art as a sign of status- each painting bore the words \"More cultured than you will ever be!\", a witty take on the cultured milk drink. This collection was reflective of Lo's post-sticker lady state as they questioned their identity as an artist.\nIn 2015, they held their first solo exhibition, the LIMPEH Show, at The Substation, comprising their LIMPEH portrait series of Lee Kuan Yew. The series started in 2011 as wheatpaste art on A4-sized papers and stickers which were later commissioned by collectors into collage paintings.On 5 November 2016, Lo painted the largest My Grandfather Road in chalk for Circular Spectacular. The chalk painting measured 170 metres long, the biggest the artist has attempted as yet.\nLo held their second exhibition, Greetings From Singapore in January 2017. On display were photographs of socially satirical stickers pasted in public spaces together that served as 'photographic evidence' of their work on the streets, leading viewers and those who are familiar with their work to question the need to document these social interruptions in a city notorious for its cleanliness. These photographs were accompanied by newspaper clippings and old photographs of the original stickers and spray paint they were arrested for in 2012. At the exhibition, they also launched a photography book of the same title chronicling their work on the streets from 2012.\n"

He complied with his family's wishes to <<<finish medical school>>> by graduating from the China Medical University in Taichung, but <<<decided to abandon a career as a physician to pursue a singing and songwriting career>>>.In 1982, Lo released his debut album Zh\u012b h\u016b zh\u011b y\u011b (\u4e4b\u4e4e\u8005\u4e5f), the title of which consists solely of grammatical particles from Classical Chinese. A ground breaking album that broadened the horizons of Chinese music and set a new model for Chinese songwriting, it spun off hits including not only the title song, but also \"Lukang, the Little Town\" (\u9e7f\u6e2f\u5c0f\u93ae), \"Love Song 1980\" (\u6200\u66f21980), and \"Childhood\" (\u7ae5\u5e74). Singing songs infused with brazen commentary on the social scene of Taiwan at that time and sporting sunglasses, his debut sparked buzz and heated discussion about the issues that his songs raised in Taiwan, such as Confucian pedantry and urban emptiness.\nHe followed with his next album in 1983, Master of the Future (\u672a\u4f86\u7684\u4e3b\u4eba\u7fc1), which features several songs: the title song which warns the listener of a future run by children without morals or humanity and \"72 Transformations\" (\u73fe\u8c61\u4e03\u5341\u4e8c\u8b8a), and \"Orphan of Asia\" (\u4e9e\u7d30\u4e9e\u7684\u5b64\u5152) which shares its title with Wu Zhuoliu's novel about the Japanese occupation of Taiwan.\nIn 1985, inspired by the success of the charity single We Are the World by USA for Africa, Lo wrote \"Tomorrow Will Be Better\" (\u660e\u5929\u6703\u66f4\u597d), a highly successful charity single of his own to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Taiwan's independence from Japanese colonial rule. It was ultimately performed by over 60 different artists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, including Tsai Chin, Chyi Chin, Chyi Yu, Sarah Chen, Eric Moo, Fei Yu-Ching, Angus Tung, and Jonathan Lee.\nLover/Comrade (\u611b\u4eba\u540c\u5fd7) was Lo's next album, released in 1988. In addition to the title song which uses political slogans in the context of a love song, the album also included \"Love Song 1990\" (\u6200\u66f21990), one of his most famous love songs that was written 6 years after he had written \"Love Song 1980.\"\nIn 1991, he wrote \"Pearl of the Orient\" (\u6771\u65b9\u4e4b\u73e0), regarded as one of his most famous songs which sings praises to Hong Kong as a symbolic haven from the perils of the Pacific and implores Hong Kong not to lose its Chinese identity in the face of rapid modernization and British colonization at that time. He also wrote \"Queen's Road East\" (\u7687\u540e\u5927\u9053\u6771), a Cantonese song he sang with Ram Chiang that satirizes the impending Hong Kong handover in 1997.\nIn 2004, Lo formally relinquished his US citizenship to protest the introduction to the US House of Representatives of a resolution regarding the deployment of Taiwanese marines to Iraq. \"[W]hen US representatives introduced a resolution requesting that Taiwan send marines to Iraq, I realized that while the US often stresses peaceful negotiations across the Taiwan Strait, the US government is the third party that stands in the way of truly peaceful negotiation,\" Lo said.On Sunday, 25 May 2008, at 7 pm PST, Lo held a live concert at San Jose State University Event Center. The concert, entitled \"Join 'N Sing\", was a celebration of the newly elected president of Taiwan, Ma Ying-jeou. There were three special guests at this show: Kao Ling Fung, Hsu Nai Ling, and Cindi Chaw Yong Hua. This show turned into a charity fundraiser for the earthquake victims of Sichuan, China.\n"

The singer excelled in social sciences at school and grew fond of literature, writing poetry and short stories. In an interview with the BBC, she explained, \"Growing up so safe, I think I was looking for something else.\" During her teens she suffered from bulimia, to which her mother sought to help her through a therapist. After her first serious relationship breakup she cut herself several times due to the embarrassment.Nilsson developed a love for music and formed a girl band with her friends. She wrote her first song with them at age 10 or 11. By age 15, Lo had written  \"all these lyrics that nobody ever saw\" and had performed twice on stage, before enrolling at Rytmus Musikergymnasiet, a Stockholm music school. During her time at Rytmus, she developed a friendship with Caroline Hjelt, who would later form the Swedish duo Icona Pop. After two years, she graduated from the school and felt assured that her career would be in music despite her parents preferring she do something else.\nIn 2006, Lo began writing songs with Christian Bjerring, a guitarist from Rytmus. The pair then formed a math rock band, Tremblebee, with three other male students from the school. They played together for \"three years in bars across Sweden, independently releasing some of their songs, before breaking up in 2009. During her time with the band, Lo developed a passion for performing on stage, and was introduced to Swedish production duo The Struts.\nAfter Tremblebee broke up, Lo's musical focus turned toward pop. She decided to work on her own tracks, spending six months in her shed studio producing a demo, while doing session singing to support herself. She learned to play the drums and became knowledgeable about music programming and record production. Lo later lived with the duo Icona Pop, in a suburb near Stockholm.Lo met an A&R man at a party in Stockholm celebrating Icona Pop's first record deal and handed him her demo. They met again by chance in a bar in London. He liked her demo and subsequently introduced her to a songwriting group which included The Struts and Hjelt. In 2011, Lo decided to pursue a career in songwriting and earned a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music. This new career path led her to travel to Los Angeles, and work with Swedish producer Max Martin. In 2012, she collaborated with British production team Xenomania and Swedish producer Alexander Kronlund, co-writing Girls Aloud's \"Something New\", Icona Pop's \"We Got the World\" and tracks for the duo's self-titled debut album.Lo then decided to manage an \"indie career on the side\", recording her more personal compositions and releasing them independently. She released her first single, \"Love Ballad\", in October 2012, and her second single, \"Habits\", in March 2013. The latter gained her a substantial online following. Throughout 2013, Max Martin and his fellow Swedish producer Shellback mentored Lo. She was featured on Swedish disc jockey Lucas Nord's single, \"Run on Love\", released in June 2013 for his album Islands. She also collaborated on the single \"Strangers\" by Seven Lions and Myon & Shane 54 for The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones film soundtrack (2013), and Seven Lions' extended play (EP), Worlds Apart (2014).  She also co-wrote Victoria Justice's \"Gold\", and tracks for Icona Pop's This Is... Icona Pop.\nAn interview and profile of Tove Lo in W magazine in October 2016 referred to her as \"openly bisexual\", citing that as one of several identifiers \"she once took for granted but are now very much part of her public persona.\" In an interview with Attitude in January 2017, Lo referred to her own bisexuality:  \"Being open and owning my sexuality in both ways\u2014with both men and women\u2014I think that's just never been a big deal\", adding that she was very lucky growing up in a liberal country. In March the same year, she gave an interview with Out magazine, stating she had never been in a relationship with a woman.Lo says she created a media image for herself that is synonymous with her true identity. She has a prominent tattoo along her left upper arm of a girl harnessed to the back of a bumblebee. It is from the cover of Jack Off Jill's album Clear Hearts Grey Flowers; the album cover was designed by Mark Ryden. Frequently barefoot during her live performances, Lo's look is often compared to that of her style icon Janis Joplin. Her other style influences include hippie fashion, and the fashion of older rock singers, the people of Stockholm and Edie Sedgwick. According to Elle writer Rebecca Moss, Lo is \"a true '90s child unwilling to part with her early iconography\". Lindsey Rhoades of The Village Voice writes, \"Tove Lo rocks a specific brand that veers slightly from most other women in pop\u2014she paints herself as the hard-drinking, hard-drugging, DTF party girl, admitting the somewhat destructive nature of these preoccupations but celebrating them all the same.\" In 2014, Lo's first clothing line, which she also modelled, is based on the lyrics of her EP, Truth Serum.Lo has voiced her frustration over censorship in the United States, including her lyrics, although she understands it is the only way to get her songs played on the radio. The artist has also commented that, \"... in Sweden, we don't really censor that way. You hear every swear word, in Swedish and English, on the radio, and kids will be singing along.\" The singer has often said in interviews that she is unapologetically proud of her body, occasionally engaging in exhibitionism at her shows. \"I started just by showing a little bit of boob or just being sassy, and everyone got so excited and then one night I just did it\", she told MTV News at Bonnaroo. Lo is often asked about being a negative role model for women, given the many sexual and drug references in her lyrics. The artist has commented she finds it normal to talk about sex since she grew up in a country where that is considered \"normal and not shameful\", and many of her fans like the way she expresses herself. Lo also believes she receives these kinds of comments due to gender double standards, adding that: \"I felt like I was getting asked all these questions because I'm a girl. ... It would be insulting to ask a guy that. Which it is to a girl as well.\"On 26 July 2020, Lo announced on her Instagram story that she had married her boyfriend, Charlie Twaddle.\n"

He <<<joined the BBC>>> where he <<<worked as a researcher>>> for Sue Lawley and Anne Robinson. He turned to directing in 1996 while working on the Granada TV current affairs programme World in Action. He went on to direct several episodes of Coronation Street in 2000, and subsequently directed episodes of Bad Girls, Waterloo Road, Shameless and Hotel Babylon.\nHis first feature film Oranges and Sunshine was released on 1 April 2011. The film starred Emily Watson as Margaret Humphreys, the social worker who exposed the scandal of child migration. It co-starred Hugo Weaving and David Wenham.In 2012, Loach directed Life of Crime, a thriller written by Declan Croghan. It centred on a young police officer's obsession with the killer of a young girl. Hayley Atwell played the lead part, supported by Richard Coyle and Con O'Neill. It transmitted on ITV to positive reviews in May 2013.In June 2015, Loach started production on his second film, Measure of a Man. Based on the coming-of-age novel One Fat Summer by Robert Lipsyte, the screenplay was written by David Scearce. The cast included Donald Sutherland, Judy Greer, Luke Wilson and Blake Cooper. The film was released nationwide in the United States on 11 May 2018 and sharply divided critics. \nMichael O'Sullivan from The Washington Post gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars and said, \"Measure of a Man is a funny, wise movie about bullying that speaks to kids and grown-ups alike\".[9] Richard Roeper at The Chicago Sun-Times gave it a 3.5 out of 4 stars and said, \"It's a sweet and knowing and lovely and funny story, but occasionally the spell of warm nostalgia is broken by painful moments of family heartbreak and cruel bullying\".[10] By contrast, Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle gave a critical review, describing it as a film of \"gestures and feints\".[12]  The film received its European premiere at the Rome Film Festival in October 2018.\nIn 2019, Loach directed Save Me Too, the sequel to Save Me, written by and starring Lennie James.

            "early_life": "Kenneth Charles Loach was born on 17 June 1936 in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, the son of Vivien (n\u00e9e Hamlin) and John Loach. He <<<attended King Edward VI Grammar School>>> and <<<at the age of 19 went to serve in the Royal Air Force>>>. He <<<read law>>> at St Peter's College, Oxford and graduated with a third-class degree. As a member of the Oxford University Experimental Theatre Club he directed an open-air production of Bartholomew Fair for the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford, in 1959 (when he also took the role of the shady horse-dealer Dan Jordan Knockem). After Oxford, he <<<began a career in the dramatic arts>>>.\nLoach <<<worked first as an actor in regional theatre companies and then as a director for BBC Television.>>> His 10 contributions to the BBC's Wednesday Play anthology series include the docudramas Up the Junction (1965), Cathy Come Home (1966) and In Two Minds (1967). They portray working-class people in conflict with the authorities above them. Three of his early plays are believed to be lost. His 1965 play Three Clear Sundays dealt with capital punishment, and was broadcast at a time when the debate was at a height in the United Kingdom. Up the Junction, adapted by Nell Dunn from her book with the assistance of Loach, deals with an illegal abortion while the leading characters in Cathy Come Home, by Jeremy Sandford, are affected by homelessness, unemployment, and the workings of Social Services. In Two Minds, written by David Mercer, concerns a young schizophrenic woman's experiences of the mental health system. Tony Garnett began to work as his producer in this period, a professional connection which would last until the end of the 1970s.During this period, he also directed the absurdist comedy The End of Arthur's Marriage, about which he later said that he was \"the wrong man for the job\". Coinciding with his work for The Wednesday Play, Loach began to direct feature films for the cinema, with Poor Cow (1967) and Kes (1969). The latter recounts the story of a troubled boy and his kestrel, and is based on the novel A Kestrel for a Knave by Barry Hines. The film was well received, although the use of Yorkshire dialect throughout the film restricted its distribution, with some American executives at United Artists saying that they would have found a film in Hungarian easier to understand. The British Film Institute named it No 7 in its list of best British films of the twentieth century, published in 1999.During the 1970s and 1980s, Loach's films were less successful, often suffering from poor distribution, lack of interest and political censorship. His documentary The Save the Children Fund Film (1971) was commissioned by the charity, who subsequently disliked it so much they attempted to have the negative destroyed. It was only screened publicly for the first time on 1 September 2011, at the BFI Southbank. During the 1980s Loach concentrated on television documentaries rather than fiction, and many of these films are now difficult to access as the television companies have not released them on video or DVD. At the end of the 1980s, he directed some television advertisements for Tennent's Lager to earn money.Days of Hope (1975) is a four part drama for the BBC directed by Loach from scripts by dramatist Jim Allen. The first episode of the series caused considerable controversy in the British media owing to its critical depiction of the military in World War I, and particularly over a scene where conscientious objectors were tied up to stakes outside trenches in view of enemy fire after refusing to obey orders. An ex-serviceman subsequently contacted The Times newspaper with an illustration from the time of a similar scene.Loach's documentary A Question of Leadership (1981) interviewed members of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation (the main trade union for Britain's steel industry) about their 14-week strike in 1980, and recorded much criticism of the union's leadership for conceding over the issues in the strike.  Subsequently, Loach made a four-part series named Questions of Leadership which subjected the leadership of other trade unions to similar scrutiny from their members, but this has never been broadcast. Frank Chapple, leader of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union, walked out of the interview and made a complaint to the Independent Broadcasting Authority. A separate complaint was made by Terry Duffy of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. The series was due to be broadcast during the Trade Union Congress conference in 1983, but Channel 4 decided against broadcasting the series following the complaints. Anthony Hayward claimed in 2004 that the media tycoon Robert Maxwell had put pressure on Central Television's  board (Central was the successor to the original production company Associated Television), of which he had become a director, to withdraw Questions of Leadership at the time he was buying the Daily Mirror newspaper and needed the co-operation of union leaders, especially Chapple.Which Side Are You On? (1985), about the songs and poems of the UK miners' strike, was originally due to be broadcast on The South Bank Show, but was rejected on the grounds that it was too politically unbalanced for an arts show. The documentary was eventually transmitted on Channel 4, but only after it won a prize at an Italian film festival. Three weeks after the end of the strike, the film End of the Battle ... Not the End of the War? was broadcast by Channel 4 in its Diverse Strands series. This film argued that the Conservative Party had planned the destruction of the National Union of Mineworkers' political power from the late 1970s.Working again with Jim Allen, Loach was due to direct Allen's play Perdition at the Royal Court Theatre in 1987. In the play Jewish leaders in Nazi-occupied Hungary allow half a million Jews to be killed in pursuit of a Zionist state in Palestine. However, following protests and allegations of antisemitism, the play was cancelled 36 hours before its premiere.In 1989, Loach directed a short documentary Time to go that called for the British Army to be withdrawn from Northern Ireland, which was broadcast in the BBC's Split Screen series.From the late 1980s, Loach directed theatrical feature films more regularly, a series of films such as Hidden Agenda (1990), dealing with the political troubles in Northern Ireland, Land and Freedom (1995), examining the Republican resistance in the Spanish Civil War, and Carla's Song (1996), which was set partially in Nicaragua. He directed the courtroom drama reconstructions in the docu-film McLibel, concerning McDonald's Restaurants v Morris & Steel, the longest libel trial in English history. Interspersed with political films were more intimate works such as Raining Stones (1993), a working-class drama concerning an unemployed man's efforts to buy a communion dress for his young daughter.\nOn 28 May 2006, Loach won the Palme d'Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival for his film The Wind That Shakes the Barley, a political-historical drama about the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent Irish Civil War during the 1920s. Like Hidden Agenda before it, The Wind That Shakes the Barley was criticised by Ruth Dudley Edwards for allegedly being too sympathetic to the Irish Republican Army and Provisional Irish Republican Army, thought it would transpire that Edwards had not seen the film. This film was followed by It's a Free World... (2007), a story of one woman's attempt to establish an illegal placement service for migrant workers in London.\nThroughout the 2000s, Loach interspersed wider political dramas such as Bread and Roses (2000), which focused on the Los Angeles janitors strike, and Route Irish (2010), set during the Iraq occupation, with smaller examinations of personal relationships. Ae Fond Kiss... (a.k.a. Just a Kiss, 2004) explored an inter-racial love affair, Sweet Sixteen (2002) concerns a teenager's relationship with his mother and My Name Is Joe (1998) an alcoholic's struggle to stay sober. His most commercial later film is Looking for Eric (2009), featuring a depressed postman's conversations with the ex-Manchester United footballer Eric Cantona appearing as himself. The film won the Magritte Award for Best Co-Production. Although successful in Manchester, the film was a flop in many other cities, especially cities with rival football teams to Manchester United.The Angels' Share (2012) is centered on a young Scottish troublemaker who is given a final opportunity to stay out of jail. Newcomer Paul Brannigan, then 24, from Glasgow, played the lead role. The film competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival where Loach won the Jury Prize. Jimmy's Hall (2014) was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Loach announced his retirement from film-making in 2014 but soon after restarted his career following the election of a Conservative government in the UK general election of 2015.Loach won his second Palme d'Or for I, Daniel Blake (2016). In February 2017, the film was awarded a BAFTA as \"Outstanding British Film\".\nLoach lives with his wife, Lesley, in Bath. They have two sons, Jim and Stephen, and two daughters, Hannah and Emma. Another son died in a car accident, aged five. Jim Loach has become a television and film director. Emma is a documentary film maker who is married to the actor Elliot Levey.Loach is a patron of the British Humanist Association and a secularist, saying \"In particular, the indoctrination of children in separate faith schools is pernicious and divisive. I strongly support the British Humanist Association.\"\nLoach turned down an OBE in 1977. In a Radio Times interview, published in March 2001, he said: It's all the things I think are despicable: patronage, deferring to the monarchy and the name of the British Empire, which is a monument of exploitation and conquest. I turned down the OBE because it's not a club you want to join when you look at the villains who've got it.\nLoach has been awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Bath, the University of Birmingham, Staffordshire University, and Keele University. Oxford University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree in June 2005. He is also an honorary fellow of his alma mater, St Peter's College, Oxford. In May 2006, he was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship at the BAFTA TV Awards.\nIn 2003, Loach received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University and received the 2003 Praemium Imperiale (lit. \"World Culture Prize in Memory of His Imperial Highness Prince Takamatsu\") in the category Film/Theatre. In 2014, he was presented with the Honorary Golden Bear at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. The Raindance Film Festival announced in September 2016 that it would be honouring Loach with its inaugural Auteur Award, to recognise his \"achievements in filmmaking and contribution to the film industry.\" He was also made Honorary Associate of London Film School.\n"

In August 2005, Loach was loaned to Spalding United. In November 2005, he had a one-match spell with Lincoln United. He returned to Boston Town later that month, before a period at Grantham Town in March 2006.\nIn February 2009, Loach's good form at club level earned him his first England under-21 international call-up by manager Stuart Pearce for a friendly match against Ecuador's senior team in Malaga. Loach made his international debut when he came on as a late replacement for Tom Heaton, as England lost 3\u20132.In May 2009, Loach was named in the England Under-21 squad for the Under-21 Championships that take place in Sweden in June 2009. He only played in one match as Joe Hart was first choice. He started in goal for England in the 4\u20130 defeat to Germany in the final of the Under-21 Championships in place of the suspended Hart and was highly culpable for the second German goal. With Hart and Joe Lewis ineligible for the under-21s, Loach began to play regularly thereafter.On 10 August 2010, after Ben Foster and Paul Robinson withdrew from the squad, Loach received his first call up to the full England squad for the friendly against Hungary. The following month, after Scott Carson withdrew from the England squad due to a bereavement, he received a second call up to the full England squad for the Euro 2012 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Switzerland.\nAs of 18 October 2022\n"

            "early_life": "The <<<son of a judge>>> who moved around Northern Queensland on judicial matters, Mark Loane was born in Ipswich, Queensland. He first attended Gympie Christian Brothers before being sent St. Joseph's Nudgee College as a boarder. He is married to Elizabeth Loane and has two daughters.\nLoane's senior rugby started in 1973 at the University of Queensland Rugby Club where he was coached by former Wallabies, Jules Guerassimoff and Chilla Wilson. State and national coach Bob Templeton was closely involved at the club. Loane came to Templeton's attention and was he selected aged eighteen to represent Australia when Tonga toured in 1973. He played in both Tests. The following year he made an appearance against the All Blacks.In 1975 he played in a Test match against Japan and in two Tests against a touring England team. He was selected that year to make the 1975\u201376 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland led by John Hipwell. Loane played in consecutive tour matches 1 through 4 but was injured in the game against London Counties and missed a number of matches including the Scottish and Welsh Tests. He played in eight straight games when he recovered, including the Tests against England and Ireland.In 1976 Loane played in all three Tests matches against the visiting Fijians and also captained Queensland against them. He was also selected for the short 1976 Australia rugby union tour of Europe under captain Geoff Shaw. Two years later when Wales visited Loane again captained Queensland against the visitors and played in two spiteful Test matches, both won. He made the 1978 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand and although Loane was in the incumbent Queensland captain, his state rival Tony Shaw was selected by coach Daryl Haberecht as the squad's captain. Injury restricted Loane to just two tour match appearances against Hawkes Bay and Manawatu.\nLoane's first Test as national captain was the 1979 Test against the All Blacks at the Sydney Cricket Ground which Australia won 12\u20136 to take back the Bledisloe Cup for the first time in 30 years. He also played against Ireland in two Tests and again captained the Queensland state side. That year the ARU showed full confidence in his leadership selecting him as squad captain for the 1979 Australia rugby union tour of Argentina, the first Wallaby tour to South America. He played in six of the seven matches including both Tests, for one win and one loss.His role in University's 1979 Grand Final victory will be remembered. The first Grand Final was drawn after extra time against traditional rivals, Brothers, and another match was scheduled for the following week to decide the victors. In all, 200 minutes of rugby had to be played before the victory could be celebrated. Once he had completed his medical studies in 1980 Loane relocated to South Africa to gain medical experience. He played rugby there in the Currie Cup and was selected as a junior Springbok. On his return to Australia in 1981 he immediately went into the Test team against France and captained Queensland against Italy.Howell asserts that Loane's career peaked in 1981 when at aged 27 he was selected under the captaincy of his state arch-rival Tony Shaw on the 1981\u201382 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland. Loane would captain the side in the Test against England when Shaw was dropped from the team following the Scottish Test. Shaw had retaliated recklessly to niggling from Scots player Bill Cuthbertson with a king-hit right in front of the referee. Shaw was to pay dearly for this as it would mark the end of his Test captaincy career. Loane also captained the side in four tour matches.Later that year Loane's stellar career came to an end after he captained Queensland and then Australia in two Tests against the visiting Scottish national side. All told Loane captained Australia for six Tests and seven other tour matches between 1979 and 1982. He captained Queensland in many matches against touring sides and in several distinctive wins over NSW from the late 70s until 1982.\nLoane graduated from the School of Medicine at the University of Queensland in 1977, before going on to complete his ophthalmology training in Queensland. He proceeded to complete Fellowships in both corneal transplantation and external eye disease (Flinders Medical Centre, South Australia) and in glaucoma (University of California San Diego, US). He has since performed more than 20,000 procedures.Loane is an ophthalmologist and practising surgeon in the Queensland public healthcare system, as well as the private system. He is a Fellow of both the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) and the Royal Australian College of Surgeons, and specialises in cataract surgery and glaucoma treatment. He works at the Surgical, Treatment and Rehabilitation Service in Herston. Loane practices in the private system through the Vision Eye Institute.Loane has been involved in a number of charitable organisations and works, including serving as Chair for the RANZCO Eye Foundation and as a board member for Guide Dogs Queensland. He also is the head of the Cape York Regional Eye Health Project, which provides specialist ophthalmic care to remote Indigenous communities in the Cape York Peninsula. The Cape York Eye Health Project was established in 1999 and visits 29 remote communities every year. Loane was awarded Membership of the Order of Australia (AM) in 2011 for his service to Indigenous health and to medicine through the project.\n"

            "early_life": "Lu was born Chu Qi Xue on April 3, 1956, in Taipei, Taiwan. His ancestral roots can be traced back to Anhui Province in Mainland China. The youngest of four sons, Lu grew up idolizing martial arts actor Chen Kuan-tai. At age 8, he was sent to the government-run Junior Lu Guang Drama School by his parents, who were struggling to support him and his siblings. There, he studied revolutionary opera with future costar and lifelong friend, Chiang Sheng. Lu, along with Chiang, Philip Kwok, Robert Tai, and Ricky Cheng would practice acrobatics near Taipei Bridge and earned pocket money playing extras in movies that were shot nearby. In addition to learning acrobatics, Lu sang, practiced martial arts and somersaults, and became proficient in various weapons. Upon graduating, he had plans to pursue a career in the professional arts but decided on film and television instead, owing to the declining popularity of Chinese opera. An avid drinker of Coca-Cola, Lu's love of the soft drink earned him the nickname Cola King.\nLu was recruited by Chang Cheh in 1975 and briefly worked as a stuntman in movies such as Ng See-yuen's Secret Rivals 2 where much of his previous acrobatic training was applied to the action choreography. His first major role was in the 1976 film Shaolin Temple. In 1978, Lu was cast as Tang Shankui a.k.a. the Centipede in Chang's Five Deadly Venoms where he also served as one of the film's action directors. Lu recalled the experience as \"very hard to put together but we had a great time doing it. In retrospect, I have nothing but good memories.\" Five Deadly Venoms enjoyed commercial success in Hong Kong and Taiwan but especially so in North America where the main cast became collectively known by fans as the Venom Mob. Lu and his cast members, however, did not become aware of the film's international popularity until several years after its release. Following the film's success, Lu frequently starred with the Venom Mob, often in villainous roles. Amongst these films was Shaolin Rescuers (1979) for which his portrayal of the main antagonist Gao Jinzhong won him Best Supporting Actor at the 25th Asia-Pacific Film Festival in Singapore. Lu regards winning the award as the highlight of his acting career and the character remains one of his favorite roles.The Venom Mob eventually disbanded in 1981. Lu's fellow Venom actor Philip Kwok attributed the split to them simply leaving Shaw's with Chang following suit, while Lo Mang believed it was due to audiences no longer wishing to see gory heroics, preferring instead the lighter, more comedic tones of Jackie Chan films. Lu, similarly, was of the opinion that the split was caused by the decline of martial art films in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and because Chang had shifted his focus to the mainland market.\nIn 1981, Lu returned to Taiwan and cofounded a film production company with Venom costars and close friends Philip Kwok and Chiang Sheng. They starred in, directed, and choreographed the company's debut film, Ninja in the Deadly Trap. Lu's film appearances decreased after completing Shanghai 13 (1984) as he shifted primarily to television at the suggestion of his childhood friend and fellow Shaw Brothers actor, Ricky Cheng. He remains active in television where he largely directs or choreographs (sometimes both) TV series from Taiwan or Mainland China. His more notable works include New Legend of Madame White Snake (1992), My Fair Princess (1997), Legend of Dagger Li (1999), and Justice Bao (2010).\nIn 2017, Lu received the Urban Fists of Legends Legacy Award and, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Five Deadly Venoms, The Martial Arts Cult Classic Cinema Award at The Urban Action Showcase and Expo in New York City.\n"

She returned to Australia after a period away in her early twenties and it was during this time that she came to terms with her gender identity as a woman and as a fa'afafine. She uses her performances to advocate for fa'afafine identity, particularly in resistance to western LGBT categorisations. These performances are situated at the confluence of gender identity, Pacific culture and intersectionality.In 2020 she curated the very first queer Pacific event at Midsumma Festival in Melbourne, and performed there with an event entitled Pacific Essence: Tales of a Migrant Plantation, which was staged at the Immigration Museum. In 2019 she was part of the ensemble cast of Gender Euphoria, which was staged as part of Melbourne International Arts Festival. Her performances are part of a \"cult phenomena\" where queer perspectives are combined with \"Indigenous knowledge-making\". Leota Lu is also outspoken about the discrimination that gender diverse members Pacific Islander communities still face. Former occupations have included community support worker.\n"

She was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 2015, and full Professor in 2020.Her research focuses on the synthesis and characterization of bimetallic complexes, especially those that contain a metal-metal bond. The Lu group has developed a series of trianionic, tripodal ligands that can coordinate two metals at close proximity, allowing for the formation for a metal-metal bond in a coordination complex. The metal-metal bond order can range from bond orders of less than one to a quintuple bond, as between manganese and chromium in a complex reported in 2013, and between two chromium atoms in a complex reported in 2015.These coordination complexes are also active for catalytic reactions of small molecules, such as the silylation of nitrogen by a dicobalt complex, and alkene hydrogenation by nickel-group 13 element complexes.\n"

            "early_life": "Crowd Lu was raised in a household rich with culture and focused on the arts in Tainan City, Taiwan. His <<<mother was a lover and collector of Western jazz records>>>, which sparked a similar\u2014if not greater\u2014musical interest within Lu at a very young age. The glimmer of Lu's talent was apparent as he would belt out the <<<songs of Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson>>> only after listening to them once or twice.  Lu's grandmother also contributed to his musical versality. His grandmother was a fan of local Taiwanese dramas and would sing theme songs from these dramas to Lu and his sister to coax them to sleep. It was most likely at this time that Lu developed his signature style- carefree, sincere, and youthful.\nAfter graduating from the Tainan Guangming High School in 2003, Lu moved north to Taipei to attend Tamkang University. Although he intended on majoring in electrical engineering, due to his near fatal car accident, Lu was forced to switch his major to Spanish Literature.\nIn his first year at Tamkang University, Lu was run over by a bus and suffered severe injuries in both legs. As a result, Lu spent months in the hospital, during which he picked up the guitar and experimented with musical composition. The following year, Lu won first prize for musical composition and solo performance at a Tamkang University singing contest and proceeded to once again take the gold in composition and to become the crowd favorite at a similar contest at National Chengchi University. Lu caught the eye, and ears, of prominent music record producer Zhong Cheng Hu, and, with Zhong, produced three singles.  Of them, \"Good Morning, Beautiful Dawn!\" appeared on the Taiwan Musical Society's Top Ten Singles in 2007. By mere word of mouth, Lu sold 15,000 CD's of his singles.\nIn late 2006, for a little more than a year, Lu toured all of Taiwan, hopping from diners to universities, and created a huge following, especially among university students.\nIn 2008, Lu ended his tour with 100 concerts and, on 25 May, came out with his first CD 100 Ways of Living. Filled with the simple honesty of everyday life, 100 Ways of Living topped the charts and altered the course of the heavily Mando-pop musical industry and taste in all of Asia dramatically.\nOn 23 August 2008, Lu had his own first official concert, only 88 days after his hit CD came out.\nIn 2009, Lu's albums Seven Days (\u4e03\u5929) and Live in Taipei International Convention Center (TICC) were both awarded one of the Top 10 Selling Mandarin Albums of the Year at the 2009 IFPI Hong Kong Album Sales Awards, presented by the Hong Kong branch of IFPI.Lu performed the  theme song of the film Your Name Engraved Herein,  the piece won Best Original Film Song at Taiwan's Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards. As of August  2022, the music video has garnered more than 58 million views on YouTube.\n"

Having been flight engineer on Soyuz TMA-2, Lu spent six months in space in 2003 as part of ISS Expedition 7, with cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko.In July 2003, Lu and Malenchenko answered questions from students participating in Japan's NASDA special educational event, where Ed Lu performed \"Happy Birthday\" on an electronic piano for a student's birthday in the live broadcast from space. He had demonstrated the difficulty of playing the piano instrument in space during a live in-orbit interview with CBS News and NASA TV video feed. Also on this ISS mission on 15 October 2003, Lu communicated with the crewman of China's first crewed mission into space, Yang Liwei, flying aboard Shenzhou 5. Lu congratulated the Chinese for the achievement and said in Putonghua: \"Welcome to space. Have a safe journey\". Malenchenko added: \"I love to have somebody else in space instead of (just) me and Ed\".While still employed at NASA, Lu co-founded the B612 Foundation along with former astronaut Rusty Schweickart and scientists Clark Chapman and Piet Hut.  It has conducted two lines of related research to help detect asteroids that could one day strike the Earth, and find the technological means for asteroid deflection. The foundation's current goal is to design and build a privately financed asteroid-finding space telescope, Sentinel, to be launched in 2017\u20132018. The Sentinel's infrared telescope, once parked in an orbit similar to that of Venus, will help identify asteroids and other near-Earth objects (NEOs) that pose a risk of collision with Earth.\nOn August 10, 2007, Lu announced he was retiring from NASA to work at Google.In June 2010, Lu left Google and worked out of the Sunfire Offices.

Scott Hubbard, Astronautics professor at Stanford University announced plans to build and operate the first privately-funded deep space mission called Sentinel. Their non-profit B612 Foundation will launch an infrared space telescope in orbit around the Sun, where from a distance as great as 270,000,000 kilometers (170,000,000 mi) from Earth, where it would detect and track asteroids and other near-Earth objects posing threats to the planet. On October 25, 2016 B612 and Lu endorsed NASA's NEOcam proposed mission and ended the Sentinel project.\nAs of 2022. Lu is working on a new project to find \"killer asteroids\" by analyzing terabytes of archived data. So far, the B612 Foundation, cofounded by Lu, has found over 100 new potentially-threatening asteroids. This immense number-crunching effort is supported in part by Google's applied artificial intelligence project. Additionally, he is currently married and has two children.\n"

He <<<worked for several years on advertising assignments>>> before going freelance <<<as a reportage photographer>>>. During his years of study at Tsinghua University, Lu <<<encountered Xie Hairong, another Chinese photographer, from whom he gained inspiration to become a photojournalist>>>.\nLu's work covers a wide range of consequences of China's rapid industrialization. A reoccurring theme is that of \"cancer villages\" in certain affected provinces, the negative environmental conditions (such as water pollution) causing these cancer villages and other related health issues, and the effect of industrialization on Chinese countrysides and its people. Lu has stated that his choice of subject in his photography is done to raise awareness in both China and on a global scale.\nShanxi province is the setting for a photograph within the series capturing severe birth defects present in the children living there.
