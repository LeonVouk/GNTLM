            "early_life": "Vedder was the Class of 1969 valedictorian at Canajoharie High School, Canajoharie, New York, and a 1973 graduate of Swarthmore College.\nVedder <<<worked in Africa for the Peace Corps>>> from 1973 to 1975. There she and her husband William Weber (Bill) worked in a small boarding school in rural south central Zaire. She taught the girls there by reminding them \"You're special -- don't ever forget that\". One day they asked her why she changed her name to her husband's if she believed everyone was special. She then decided to change her last name from Weber back to Vedder upon returning to the United States. Her time in Zaire inspired her interest in wildlife conservation. This feeling intensified at Zaire's Kahuzi-Biega <<<National Park where she observed Casimir, an enormous male eastern lowland gorilla>>>. This encounter made her want to work with wildlife in Africa after the Peace Corps.\nIn 1975, Vedder returned to the United States where <<<she began searching for a graduate school where they could launch her career in wildlife conservation>>>. She and Bill chose the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. From one of their graduate program's classmates, the couple learned about British primatologist Richard Wrangham who recently visited Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park. In October 1977 they met Dian Fossey in Chicago, where she accepted their research proposal and set a tentative date for their arrival in Rwanda.\nIn 1978 she arrived in Rwanda with her husband to study gorillas at Karisoke, the research station run by Fossey. They arrived right after poachers has killed a mountain gorilla named Digit who was famous due to Fossey's research. The couple had secured research funding from the Wildlife Conservation Society. There she tried to nurse a wounded gorilla named Mweza back to health but did not succeed. This experience left her and Bill angry. With that anger, they chose to focus on ways to help the gorilla population. Amy followed Gorilla Group 5 and wrote down everything they ate and where. This information helped her figure out the type of habitat and how much the gorillas needed. After six weeks of following the group, the gorillas started to accept her presence for longer periods of time. She took notes on a specific gorilla in the group each day, noting how often and what the gorilla ate.\nAfter getting a doctorate at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1989, <<<she became Biodiversity Coordinator for the Wildlife Conservation Society>>>, and later director of the conservation of the society's Africa Program.\nOne of Vedder's contributions was to implement the Mountain Gorilla Project (subsequently the International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP)), which sought to involve local Rwandans and use ecotourism to help conserve the gorillas.\n"

            "early_life": "Vedder was born Edward Louis Severson III on December 23, 1964 in Evanston, Illinois, to Karen Lee Vedder and Edward Louis Severson Jr. His parents divorced in 1965 when Vedder was an infant. His mother soon remarried to a man named Peter Mueller. Vedder was raised believing that Mueller was his biological father, and he went by the name Edward Mueller for a time. Vedder's ancestry includes Dutch, German, and Danish on his mother' side (Vedder) and Norwegian on his father's side (Severson).While living in Evanston, Vedder's family fostered seven younger children in a group home. In the mid-1970s, the family, including Vedder's three younger half-brothers, moved to San Diego County, California. Vedder <<<received a guitar from his mother on his 12th birthday>>>, and began turning to music and surfing as a source of comfort. <<<He especially found solace in The Who's 1973 album, Quadrophenia>>>. He said, \"When I was around 15 or 16...I was all alone\u2014except for music.\" His mother and Mueller divorced when Vedder was in his late teens. His mother and brothers moved back to the Chicago area, but Vedder remained with his stepfather in California so he did not have to change schools.\nAfter the divorce, Vedder learned the truth about his parentage and that Mueller was really his stepfather, not his father. Vedder met his biological father briefly as a child, but was led to believe that Severson was merely an old friend of his parents. By the time Vedder learned the truth, Severson had died of multiple sclerosis. During his senior year at San Dieguito High School, Vedder moved out to live in an apartment, supported himself with a nightly job at a drug store in Encinitas. Because of the pressure of work and school, Vedder dropped out of high school. He joined the rest of his family in the Chicago area, and changed his last name to Vedder, his mother's maiden name.\nIn the early 1980s, while working as a waiter, Vedder earned his high school GED from Oakton Community College.\nIn 1984, Vedder returned to San Diego with his girlfriend Beth Liebling and his friend Frank. While living in the San Diego area, Vedder <<<recorded demo tapes at his home>>> and worked various jobs, including as a contracted security guard at the La Valencia Hotel in La Jolla. Vedder had several stints in San Diego area bands, including Surf and Destroy and the Butts. One of those bands, called Indian Style, included future Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave drummer Brad Wilk.In 1988, Vedder <<<became the vocalist for Bad Radio, a San Diego-based progressive funk rock band.>>> The band's original incarnation was influenced by Duran Duran; however, after Vedder joined, <<<the band moved to a more alternative rock sound influenced in part by the Red Hot Chili Peppers>>>.\nVedder attended San Dieguito High School, now called San Dieguito Academy, and donated proceeds from a 2006 Pearl Jam concert in San Diego toward the construction of a theater for the school in the name of his former drama teacher, Clayton E. Liggett. Liggett was Vedder's mentor in high school. Vedder wrote the song \"Long Road\" (from Merkin Ball) upon hearing of Liggett's death in 1995.While living in the basement of Pearl Jam manager Kelly Curtis' house in Seattle in the early 1990s, Vedder was roommates with Alice in Chains guitarist and vocalist Jerry Cantrell. Vedder was also friends with Alice in Chains' lead singer Layne Staley, and wrote the song \"4/20/02\" (from Lost Dogs) on the night that he found out about Staley's death, on April 20, 2002 (though Staley had actually died over two weeks earlier on April 5, his body was found on April 19). Vedder also paid tribute to Staley during a Pearl Jam show in Chicago on August 22, 2016, which would have been Staley's 49th birthday; \"It's the birthday of a guy called Layne Staley tonight, and we're thinking of him tonight too. 49 years old\", Vedder told the crowd before dedicating the song \"Man of the Hour\" to his late friend.In 1994, Vedder married Hovercraft bass player Beth Liebling, whom he was dating since he was a teenager, circa 1984. Vedder was Hovercraft's drummer during their opening slot for Mike Watt's U.S. tour in 1995. The couple divorced in September 2000. In an interview published in the June 29, 2006 edition of Rolling Stone magazine, Vedder said that his divorce from Liebling had devastated him. The divorce happened around the same time as the biggest tragedy of Pearl Jam's career, when nine fans were crushed to death during the band's set at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark on June 30, 2000. In an interview with Chris Cornell's daughter Lily in 2020, Vedder explained that their show started on a high because they had just been told about her birth, until about 40 minutes into their performance when the tragedy happened. Vedder revealed that Pete Townshend helped him through the early stages of dealing with the tragedy.On September 18, 2010, Vedder married his longtime girlfriend, model Jill McCormick, whom he had been dating since 2000. They have two daughters, Olivia, born in 2004, and Harper, born in 2008. In 2011, McCormick appeared in the music video for Vedder's solo single, \"Longing to Belong\". In 2014, Vedder and McCormick co-founded the EB Research Partnership, a non-profit organization dedicated to finding a cure for the genetic skin disorder epidermolysis bullosa. They have raised over $25 million to fund research to find a cure.Vedder was a close friend of the late Chris Cornell, the Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman. Aside from Vedder's Pearl Jam bandmates, Cornell was one of the first people Vedder met after moving to Seattle in 1990. The two were neighbors for a while and shared vocal duties in Temple of the Dog. In the 2009 book Grunge Is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music, Soundgarden manager Susan Silver recalled that Cornell carried Vedder onstage on his shoulders at Pearl Jam's second show in Seattle (the band was known as Mookie Blaylock at the time): \"Everyone was still reeling from [Andrew Wood]'s death... The band came on and Chris carried Eddie onto the stage \u2013 he was on his shoulders. It was one of those super powerful moments, where it was all a big healing for everybody. He came out as this guy who had all the credibility in the world \u2013 in terms of people in Seattle \u2013 and Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone were loved bands. Andy was such an endearing personality. It was a hard thing to do \u2013 to show up after people die. And Chris bringing Eddie out, and pointing at him, as much Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready recalled that Cornell had helped welcome the \"'super, super shy'\" Vedder to Seattle: \"He was like, 'Hey, welcome to Seattle. I love Jeff [Ament] and Stone [Gossard]. I give you my blessing\". From then on [Vedder] was more relaxed. It was one of the coolest things I saw Chris do'\". In a 2009 interview with Uncut magazine, Vedder stated that Cornell is \"the best singer that we've got on the planet\". About the impact that Cornell had in his life, Vedder told a crowd in Alpine Valley before performing \"Hunger Strike\" with him in September 2011; \"I had no idea how he would affect my life and my views on music and my views on friendship and what a big impact he would have. These guys [the other members of Pearl Jam] know him much longer than me and his impact is profound\". The friendship between Vedder and Cornell is featured in the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty. During his solo concert in London on June 6, 2017, Vedder talked for the first time about Cornell since his death on May 18, 2017, saying that \"he wasn't just a friend, he was someone I looked up to like my older brother\" and \"I will live with those memories in my heart and I will love him forever\".Vedder is a friend of The Who guitarist Pete Townshend, who discouraged Vedder from retiring in 1993. In late 2007, Vedder wrote the foreword to a new Pete Townshend biography, Who Are You: The Life of Pete Townshend. The book was published in the UK in March 2008 and in the U.S. in October 2008. Vedder was a close friend of the late Ramones guitarist Johnny Ramone, with Vedder being at his side when he died. Since Ramone's death, Vedder and Pearl Jam have played the Ramones' \"I Believe in Miracles\" regularly at live shows. While driving home from Ramone's funeral, Vedder wrote the lyrics for the Pearl Jam song \"Life Wasted\" (from Pearl Jam).While surfing with Tim Finn in New Zealand on March 25, 1995, Vedder was carried 250 feet (76 m) off the coast and had to be rescued by lifeguards. He also has paddled outrigger canoes on occasion and in 2005 was nearly lost at sea trying to paddle from Moloka'i to Oahu.Vedder has written songs and lyrics that question religious authority. Vedder is a Chicago Bulls and Chicago Bears fan and a long-time, die-hard fan of the Chicago Cubs. In November 1993, Vedder and White Sox pitcher Jack McDowell were involved in a barroom brawl in New Orleans, Louisiana that resulted in Vedder being arrested for public drunkenness and disturbing the peace. Vedder sang the national anthem before the third game of the 1998 NBA Finals in Chicago, and has sung \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" at six Cubs games, including Game 5 of the 2016 World Series. In 2007, a few days before performing with Pearl Jam in Chicago for Lollapalooza, he threw out the first pitch at Wrigley Field, the home of the Cubs. Vedder wrote a song at the request of former Cubs shortstop and first baseman Ernie Banks paying tribute to the Cubs called \"All the Way\". The day after the Cubs won the 2016 World Series, the Cubs' official Twitter account posted a montage video backed by Vedder's song in a tribute to Cubs fans.The annual series between the Seattle Mariners and San Diego Padres is often nicknamed the Vedder Cup due to both cities being hometowns of the singer.The singer is also a great admirer of the late American science fiction author Kurt Vonnegut. During an interview with Uncut Magazine, he stated that the novel Cat's Cradle is his favorite book of all time.\n"

Her role went largely unnoticed due to the film being based around Arjun's action image, with a critic labelling her performance as \"adequate\". After the release of Madrasi, Vedhika went on to sign a big budget Hindi language film, Jai Santoshi Maa, a remake of the 1975 film of the same name, but the film failed to subsequently materialize and Vedhika continued acting in South Indian films. She went on to feature in Raghava Lawrence's comedy horror Muni, but her role was minimal once again and the film went to become an average grosser commercially. Her maiden Telugu venture was in Vijayadasami, a remake of the Tamil film Sivakasi, where her performance was described as \"okay\" and \"average\" by critics.Her first release in 2008, the Silambarasan-starrer Kaalai, received negative reviews and became a commercial failure. However, the film became notable for the dance number, \"Kutti Pisase\" with Vedhika's dancing being critically appreciated. She went on to appear in a second successive film which was panned by critics and which became a financial failure with a role in Sakkarakatti. The long-delayed film featured Shanthnoo Bhagyaraj making his debut in the lead role and A. R. Rahman providing the soundtrack, however Vedhika's role was described as one of the sole positives from the project. Later that year, she starred in a Kannada film, Sangama opposite Ganesh, and the film fetched her good reviews for her performance. In 2009, she appeared as the radio jockey Anjali in A. Venkatesh's Malai Malai with the film consequently going on to become a success commercially. The film had little scope for Vedhika and reviews cited her role as \"pure eye candy\" whilst claiming she was \"apt\" for the role. She made a comeback to Telugu films in the same year, with a role in the critically acclaimed Baanam. Her role won her plaudits, whilst her on screen presence with Nara Rohit was praised with a critic citing she gives \"good company as the na\u00efve girl\" and it is \"refreshing to see them together\". After the release of Baanam, Kumar went on a sabbatical and did not sign any other films until, despite making an appearance in a notable advert with Karthi for mobile company Airtel.

            "early_life": "Aida Vedishcheva was born in Kazan (administrative center of Tatar ASSR) in the doctor's family of scientist, professor of dentistry Solomon Weiss and surgeon Elena Emelyanova, who arrived from Kyiv just before World War II. In 1951, the Ministry of Health offered professor Weiss to open faculty of therapeutic dentistry in Irkutsk, Siberia. There, Vedishcheva <<<finished her School and Music School>>>.\nAfterwards (by her parents' request), she enrolled into the Pedagogical Institute of the foreign languages, where she studied both the German and English languages and at the same time <<<she was performing in the student theater of the musical comedy>>>. Upon graduating from the institute, Vedishcheva <<<left for Moscow, to fulfill her dream of becoming an actress-singer>>>. She tried to enroll into the Mikhail Shchepkin Higher Theatre School but failed. After that, she began her singing career due to her strong and beautiful voice.\nAida Vedishcheva began her singing performance career in the early 1960s, in Orel State Philharmonic Society. Vedishcheva sang in the famous jazz orchestras of Oleg Lundstrem and later of Leonid Utyosov orchestras. From 1966 on, she was performing along with the \"Meloton\" ensemble as well as the Vocal-instrumental ensemble (VIE) \"Blue Guitars\" led by Igor Granov. The same year (1966), Vedishcheva became a laureate of the First \"All-Union Competition of Soviet Song\". She achieved the national recognition after singing \"Song About Bears\" in 1967 for the movie Kidnapping, Caucasian Style (seven and a half million records were sold). The song from the movie-musical \"Red, Blue, Green\" (1967). In 1968, for the song \"Geese, Geese\" (\"Gusi, gusi\") she received a diploma at the Sopot International song festival (the Polish Baltic Sea coast). That was followed by such songs/movie soundtracks as \"Volcano of Desires\" (\"Help Me\") for the movie The Diamond Arm (1968), the soundtrack for the movie \"White Piano\" with the song \"I'll Wait for You\", \"The First Spring\". With the song \"Comrade\" (1970), Vedishcheva won the 1st prize on the competition at the Moscow radio station \"Youth\". The record of this song was sold by millions by the record firm \"Melodia\" and became the hymn of youth of 1970's. The next hit from Aida came with \"Forest Deer\" from the movie Way to go Nastia!\". These popular songs of Ms. Vedishcheva has been sold by firm \"Melodia\" in circulation of 30 million copies. \nDespite her great success among the listeners, she met numerous obstacles from the Soviet officials. One of the reasons was the anti-Semitism politics of Sergey Lapin, the chairman of All-Union Radio as well as her unauthorized performance in Sopot Festival shortly after the events of the Prague Spring (after which she was blacklisted by the USSR Ministry of Culture). Among such obstacles there were cases when her name not making into movies' credits, prohibition of concert tours abroad, even cancellation of concerts, cold receptions on television, erased tapes with her recordings on the radio. For example, her song \"Forest Deer\" was recognized as the Song of the Year, but on the television instead of Aida it was performed by Loktev ensemble. From the mid-1970s on, Vedishcheva's name disappeared from the credits of some movies and cartoons. In 1980, she finally left with her mother and son to the New York.\nIn New York, Vedishcheva had to start her singing career from the ground up. She enrolled in Brooklyn College, taking a course of theater program, where she studied American history of Hollywood, Broadway, cinematography, and dance. At first, Vedishcheva resided in New York City, then she moved to Los Angeles. In the US she was able to receive recognition, creating her own theatrical One Woman Show, performing at Carnegie Recital Hall, Avery Fisher Hall of Lincoln Center and other venues under the pseudonym \"Amazing Aida\" (that's how she was called by the press of Miami, Florida). At that time her repertoire included: numbers from the popular Broadway musicals and Hollywood movies as well as the great hits of French composer Michel Legrand, her Russian hits, as well as Jewish folk songs.In the beginning of the 1990s, Aida Vedishcheva was diagnosed with stage III cancer. Despite doctors' precautions, Vedishcheva insisted on her surgery and went through chemotherapy - treatments to which the disease yielded.In 1998, Vedishcheva put on the show Miss Liberty for the new millennium. After the September 11 attacks she wrote the musical \"Masterpiece and the singing Liberty\" and dedicated it to the Statue of Liberty. The musical was performed on Broadway in 2007.In 1985, she moved to Los Angeles. In 2001, her biography was included in the Historical Book \"Who is Who in Russian Speaking California\", Copyright 2001 American Russian Business Council, Control Number 2002100217.\n"

She eventually joined the Communist Party of France, which essentially gave her an unlimited-entry visa into the Soviet Union, and provided Vysotsky with some immunity against prosecution by the government. The problems of his long-distance relationship with Vlady inspired several of Vysotsky's songs.\n"

From 1992 till March 2008, he worked for various law firms in Ukraine (as a partner of Magisters from 2006). In March 2008 Vlasenko <<<was appointed deputy head of the State Tax Administration>>> of Ukraine.\nIn 2007 Vlasenko became a member of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party. in the 2007 parliamentary elections he was placed at number 170 on the electoral list of  the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc and was not elected into the Ukrainian Parliament. In June 2008, Vlasenko became People's Deputy of Ukraine and a member of the faction of the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc. After he left the post of deputy head of the State Tax Administration.Vlasenko is Yulia Tymoshenko's lawyer in the various court cases against her (since 2010).Vlasenko was placed at number 20 on the electoral list of Batkivshchina during the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election. He was re-elected into parliament. Vlasenko is a member of Batkivshchina.On 21 January 2013, Vlasenko stated that he stood accused of car theft, robbery and failing to obey a court ruling stemming from his divorce several years ago. On 5 March 2013, this investigation was \"closed for lack of crime\". As of 13 March 2013, Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating the allegations of Vlasenko's former wife that he beat her; as a result of this, Vlasenko can not leave Ukraine.On 28 February 2013, Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Volodymyr Rybak inquired to the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine on depriving Vlasenko of his seat in parliament because he continued to engage in other than parliamentary activity. Vlasenko claimed his legal license was annulled and he was no longer engaged in any extra-parliamentary activity. On 5 March 2012 European Union (EU) Commissioner for Enlargement \u0160tefan F\u00fcle and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Catherine Ashton called on the Ukrainian authorities to address this situation so as to avoid creating any perception of misuse of the judiciary for political purposes. The U.S. Department of State agreed with the EU on this and added the case appeared to be politically motivated due to Vlasenko's connection with Yulia Tymoshenko. The Higher Administrative Court annulled the parliamentary mandate of Vlasenko on 6 March 2013. \u0160tefan F\u00fcle considered this \"not European way\" the same day.On 4 March 2014, the Verkhovna Rada returned a deputy mandate to Vlasenko, and Speaker Oleksandr Turchynov said that \"according to a Higher Administrative Court ruling of February 28, 2014, Vlasenko is a people's deputy\". The Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office closed criminal proceedings against Vlasenko \"due to the absence of a crime in his actions\" on 14 March 2014.In the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election he was again re-elected into parliament; this time after placing 15th on the electoral list of Batkivshchina.In addition to his work in parliament, Vlasenko is a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). He serves on the Assembly's Committee on the Election of Judges to the European Court of Human Rights; the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights; the Committee on Migration, Refugees and Displaced Persons; and the Sub-Committee on the implementation of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.\n"

Bombs were sawed to extract the TNT inside, which was used to catch fish. The outer shells were sold to recyclers as scrap metal. \nHer father was injured by a bomb on a nearby hill. He needed a corneal graft and it took him 6 months to recover.\nThe bomb accident tore her family apart, causing numerous events later. \"It was not a big deal though\", Linh said. \"The big deal is that every year, around 4,000 people in Vietnam are severely injured and die due to accidents with explosives. The danger is not a deterrent for bomb sawyers, who regard it as their only source of income.  It is ridiculous, isn't it?\"\n\"\nBeing someone who was once poor at English, Linh knew the disadvantages facing people who can't speak English. When Linh went to Aruchour village \u2013 a remote area in Nepal to do volunteer work - she found out people over there speak English very well although they are very poor. Linh spent a whole day in the library of a primary school reading a Nepalese English textbook. Then, she made a comparison with the English textbooks in Vietnam and realized there was something wrong in the English textbooks for Vietnamese students. She then wrote a letter to the Minister of Education. After publishing it on Facebook, the letter received more than 24.000 \"Like\" clicks and more than 10.000 \"Share\" clicks and later went viral. Linh said, \"I still don't know why people appreciated me after that. I suppose that anybody can write a letter like me, to say anything they want to say. That was not bravery.

            "early_life": "After <<<training to be a ballet dancer and also exploring the American dance tradition>>>, Vo-Dinh expanded her learning experience at the Merce Cunningham School in New York. Back in France, she danced with Fran\u00e7ois Raffinot from 1991 to 1996. In 1997, she founded the Sui Generis company. She was noticed early on for her distinctive style.\nIn 1999, she was awarded a Villa Medicis Hors-les murs grant for her research in creating Texture/Composite, for which she was awarded the Prix d\u2019Auteur at the Rencontres chor\u00e9graphiques internationales de Bagnolet in 2000. The piece was subsequently presented at Danspace Project in New York in 2002. Since then her productions have been presented on a regular basis both in France and abroad. In January 2012, Vo-Dinh became the director of Le Phare, Centre Chor\u00e9graphique National du Havre Haute-Normandie, ushering in a new artistic vision that has reached out to a diversity of choreographic styles.\nVo-Dinh's wide-ranging choreography has been shaped through the process of creating new work. While she initially focused on choreographing in a more formal way, her methodology gradually evolved toward an open-ended process affording a prominent role to improvisation in the studio. Surrounded by close collaborators, Vo-Dinh works with her performers on a long-term basis.\nSeveral pieces have been deeply rooted in scientific and anthropological research on human beings, romantic relationships, absence, the lack of emotion and schizophrenia. The art world has also informed her work: between figurative and abstract in the visual arts, as well as in the relationship between bodies in motion and the music of Beethoven, Dusapin, Zeena Parkins or G\u00e9rard Grisey. Although the choreographic structure often draws on minimalism to the point of repeating and transforming a single motif, Vo-Dinh has mainly focused on time, how it is perceived and its relationship to memory and memories. After a long absence, fragmented narration has surfaced in her latest pieces \u2013 a new approach to time and point of view, as well as to the body and how it relates to others.\nVo-Dinh readily accepts invitations, including Rainbow, her piece for amateur dancers in collaboration with David Monceau, and her work with the writer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mauche for Concordanse. Beginning with Histoires Exquises in 2011, she has invited choreographers to create solos from oral testimonies, the starting point for opening up the creative process to audiences. That willingness to share and her curiosity about other approaches to dance were to be the leitmotif in her vision for the CCN du Havre. Since 2012, Vo-Dinh has endeavored to make Le Phare a platform for many different kinds of choreography \u2013 during key moments such as the Pharenheit festival, as well as throughout the year, bringing the CCN to life in order to showcase dance in all it vibrancy.\nSince 2014, she has been the president of the Association des Centres Chor\u00e9graphiques Nationaux, a network comprising nineteen national choreographic centers in France. Vo-Dinh was awarded the insignia of Chevalier de l\u2019ordre des Arts et des Lettres in July 2014.\n"

It was during this period that Voelz found a used acoustic guitar for $25 and learned to play it, although the violin never ceased to be her primary instrument.\nAfter graduating high school, Voelz majored in English and in Music (Violin), graduating from Indiana University. After relocating several times, she found herself living in what had become a college town with a thriving mecca for artists during that time: Austin, Texas.

He started to take his first photos with a small 35mm point-and-shoot camera while spending one year as an exchange student in New Jersey. Later, during his studies in cultural anthropology and philosophy at Leiden University, he grew more interested in photography and learned the profession by assisting fashion and architectural photographers, both in the Netherlands and in New York, where he attended several courses at the School of Visual Arts in 1989. His first photo trips brought him to the industrial Ruhrgebiet in Germany, but also to the impoverished inner cities of New York, where he photographed the South Bronx and Harlem.In New York, Voeten was accepted by the photo agency Impact Visuals and did his first assignments for magazines such as Details, EAR and High Times in which he both wrote and took photos. He researched the Provo movement in the Netherlands, covered the race riots in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn (1989), reported from the elections in Nicaragua (1990) and photographed the SCUD attacks on Tel Aviv during the first Gulf War in 1991.\nVoeten obtained his master's in anthropology in 1991 after carrying out three months of fieldwork using participant observation in a remote community of gold diggers in the Andes in Ecuador. After his graduation, he moved to Brussels and started to cover the unfolding civil war in Yugoslavia. In the following years, he became a full-time war correspondent, covering the conflicts in Haiti, Rwanda, Colombia, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Sudan for publications in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and the USA.\nIn 1998 Voeten became headline news in the Netherlands when he went missing during the civil war in Sierra Leone. The Dutch Journalist Association NVJ was ready to send a search mission of fellow journalists, when Voeten resurfaced after hiding for two weeks from rebels searching for him.In 2000, Voeten was accepted in the London-based agency Panos Pictures, and moved to New York. Together with writer Sebastian Junger, he made several reportages for Vanity Fair about the mass killings in Kosovo, blood diamonds in Sierra Leone, the civil war in Liberia, women-trafficking on the Balkans, American army units in Afghanistan and the controversial Chinese entrepreneurs in Africa. In 2001, together with writer Andrew Cockburn, he covered the trail of conflict diamonds in Sierra Leone, DR Congo and Angola for National Geographic magazine.\nVoeten arrived in Baghdad just after the American-led invasion of 2003 and photographed the immediate aftermath of the war. Six months later he returned to Iraq and was embedded with the US forces for Maclean's magazine with Canadian writer Sacha Trudeau. Over the last years, Voeten photographed the American troops in Afghanistan a few more times more. He also worked in the Gaza strip (Israeli bombardments), the DR Congo (ongoing civil war) and North Korea (daily life and socialist-realist architecture) as well as the refugee crisis in the Darfur area. He also focused on more documentary subjects such as daily life in Iran and coal mining and pollution in China. He later covered the Mexican drug war and the Arab uprisings of 2012 in Egypt and Libya. From 2014 to 2017, he also photographed in Syria and Iraq. CNN published his architectural photographs of the destruction of Sinjar.Work from Voeten has appeared in Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, National Geographic, Newsweek, Time, Granta, Village Voice, Vrij Nederland, De Volkskrant, NRC, De Standaard and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. He is also a contributor for humanitarian agencies such as International Committee of the Red Cross, Human Rights Watch, M\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res, UNHCR and Amnesty International and other non-governmental organizations.\n"

He received his Abitur in Munich in 1953, and began <<<studies in political science, history, sociology, and economics>>>, first in Heidelberg and then in Munich. He received his doctorate in 1960, while <<<working as a research assistant at the Institute of Political Science at the University>>> of Heidelberg. He <<<became a lecturer>>> there the following year, also working in adult education.\nIn 1963, Vogel was elected to the municipal council of Heidelberg, but resigned two years later, following his election to the Bundestag. He joined the governing board of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany in the Rhineland Palatinate in 1965. From 1965 to 1967, Vogel was a member of the German Bundestag, a position from which he resigned to assume the job of State Minister of Culture and Education in Rhineland-Palatinate under Minister President Peter Altmeier. He continued in the same cabinet position under Altmeier's successor in 1969, Helmut Kohl. In 1973, when Kohl became chair of the national CDU, Vogel succeeded him as state party chair in Rhineland-Palatinate.\nIn December 1976, Vogel became Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate to replace Kohl, who had been elected a federal deputy. Vogel immediately assumed the presidency of the Federal Council until 31 October 1977, at the same time becoming chairman of the supervisory board of the Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF), Germany's second largest public broadcaster. In the regional elections of March 1979 he maintained a bare majority of his party, with 50% of the vote and 51 regional deputies out of 100. In March 1983 the party improved its position, obtaining 52% of the vote and 57 deputies. Vogel became vice-president of the European Democratic Union (EDU) in 1985 and again won the regional elections on 17 May 1987 but with only a plurality of 45.1% of the vote and 48 deputies elected out of 100, ending the sixteen-year absolute majority of Christian Democrats. Vogel's failure to be re-elected as state chair of his party in 1988 led to his resignation as Minister President in a famous speech which he ended with the often-quoted phrase: \"May God protect Rhineland-Palatinate!\", an unusual display of public piety by German standards.\nAfter his resignation, Vogel concentrated on the management of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, of which he became chairman in 1989. After the resignation of the first Thuringian Prime Minister Josef Ducha\u010d 1992, Vogel became Minister-President of Thuringia on 5 February. From 1993 to 1999 he was chairman of the Thuringian CDU. He gave up the chairmanship of the Adenauer Foundation in 1995. 1994 CDU and SPD formed a grand coalition. In the 1999 elections, the CDU achieved an absolute majority. For reasons of age, Vogel resigned from office as Minister-President on 5 June 2003. His was followed by Dieter Althaus.\nFrom 2001 until 2009, Vogel served again as president of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Berlin.\nIn 2012 Vogel was awarded the Mercator Visiting Professorship for Political Management at the Universit\u00e4t Essen-Duisburg's NRW School of Governance.

Vogel moved to University College London for a second master's in mathematical biology. She left London for Cambridge for her doctoral research, where she specialized in computational biology in the laboratory of Cyrus Chothia. In 2005 Vogel was appointed a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas at Austin.\nVogel was appointed as an assistant professor at the New York University in 2011. Vogel has studied the mechanisms involved with protein signalling. The creation of proteins involve messenger RNA molecules from the genes encoded within DNA. Both the generation of RNA and formation of proteins are coupled to one another, akin to the coupling of a moving escalator with someone walking upon it. Vogel has shown that both processes, the generation of RNA and the arrangement of RNA into proteins, are important. She demonstrated that the process of generating RNA from DNA is pulsed-like: brief spikes of activity that relax to a ground state, whereas the creation of proteins was more like an on-off switch.Vogel is interested in how genes respond to different stressors and how certain environmental conditions can give rise to mutations such as cancer. Amongst these genes, Vogel has studied BRCA1, which, if functioning properly, can prevent cells from dividing or growing. Mutations on the BRCA1 means that damage to DNA cannot be repaired, such that cells mutate and cause cancer. Vogel believes that by understanding the pathways involved with these processes she will be able to design drugs to counter this BRCA1 mutation. In 2019, her laboratory was named a Pressure BioSciences Center for Excellence.Vogel has served as an editor for PLoS Computational Biology.\n"

Although it may be argued that a major methodological interest of the Baroque hypothesis lies in its very imprecision, his book, \u00c9pist\u00e9m\u00e8 baroque: le mot et la chose (Hermann, 2013) provides a new theory for a concept which JC Vuillemin associates with the epistemological breakdown Europe experienced in the wake of the emergence of Modern science. As a conceptual framework in which poetics, politics, and epistemology interact, his conception of the Baroque is much less aesthetic than purposefully philosophical. According to JC Vuillemin, Sapere aude  ('dare to know') should be the motto of the Baroque.\nJC Vuillemin collaborated to the first critical edition of Jean Rotrou\u2019s complete theater (Belles-Lettres / Sorbonne-Paris-4, 1998-2019) and he published in 2017 an on-going annotated digital bibliography: Jean de Rotrou: bibliographie critique [1]. Vuillemin collaborated as well to the first Dictionary of Seventeenth-Century French Philosophers (Thoemmes Press / CNRS; trans. for Classiques Garnier). In addition to his book on Baroque episteme, he wrote one book on Rotrou\u2019s dramaturgy (Baroquisme et th\u00e9\u00e2tralit\u00e9), three critical editions of Rotrou's plays (L\u2019Hypocondriaque; L\u2019Innocente Infid\u00e9lit\u00e9; La Belle Alphr\u00e8de), and he has authored many articles, book chapters, and reviews. He frequently lectures on both sides of the Atlantic. In his latest book, Foucault l'intempestif (Hermann, 2019), JC Vuillemin revisits and clarifies some key concepts of the so-called \"pens\u00e9e Foucault,\" and pleads for the emergence of a \"post-Cartesian\" subject whose discourse (logos) will be congruent with his or her actions (ergon).\n"

            "early_life": "Weah was born and raised in the Clara Town district of Monrovia. He is a member of the Kru ethnic group, which hail from south-eastern Liberia's Grand Kru County, one of the poorest areas of the country. His father, William T. Weah Sr., was a mechanic while his mother, Anna Quayeweah (d. 2013), was a merchant. He has three brothers, William, Moses and Wolo. He was one of thirteen children largely raised by his devoutly Christian paternal grandmother, Emma Klonjlaleh Brown after his parents separated when George was still a baby. He attended middle school at Muslim Congress and high school at Wells Hairston High School, and reportedly dropped out in his final year of studies. He began to play football for the Young Survivors youth club at the age of 15 and later moved to other local football clubs, assuming starring roles for Mighty Barrolle and Invicible Eleven. Before his football career allowed him to move abroad, Weah worked for the Liberia Telecommunications Corporation as a switchboard technician.\nAfter playing in the Liberian domestic league at the beginning of his successful career and winning several national honors (including the Liberian Premier League and the Liberian Cup), Weah's abilities were discovered by the Cameroon national team coach, Claude Le Roy, who relayed the news to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Weah moved to Europe in 1988, for just \u00a312,000 from Cameroonian club Tonnerre Yaound\u00e9, when he was signed by Wenger \u2013 the manager of Monaco at the time \u2013 who flew to Africa himself prior to the signing, and whom Weah credits as an important influence on his career. During his time with Monaco, Weah won the African Footballer of the Year for the first time in 1989; this was his first major award and he took it back home for the entire country to celebrate. Weah also won the Coupe de France in 1991, and he helped Monaco reach the final of the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1992, scoring four goals in nine cup appearances.\n\nWeah subsequently played for Paris Saint-Germain (1992\u201395), with whom he won the Coupe de France in 1993 and 1995, the French league in 1994, and the Coupe de la Ligue in 1995 during a highly prolific and successful period; he also became the top scorer of the 1994\u201395 UEFA Champions League, with seven goals, after reaching the semi-finals with the club, one of which was a skilful individual \"wonder-goal\" against Bayern Munich in the group stage, on 23 November 1994. During his time at the club, he also managed to reach the semi-finals of the 1992\u201393 UEFA Cup, and the semi-finals of the 1993\u201394 European Cup Winners' Cup; in total, he scored 16 goals in 25 European games. In 1994, he won the African Footballer of the Year Award for the second time in his career.\nFollowing his time in England, Weah returned to France and had a spell at Marseille, where he remained until May 2001. He later played with Al-Jazira in the UAE Pro-League, where he remained until his retirement as a player in 2003, at age 37. He had planned on joining the New York/New Jersey MetroStars of Major League Soccer, but elected to join Al-Jazira on a temporary basis.\nSince making his debut for the Liberia national team against Sierra Leone in 1986, Weah played 75 games over 20 years, scoring 18 goals. Representing one of the smaller nations in world football and perennial underdogs, Weah did much to support the national squad: aside from being the team's star player, he also later coached the squad and even funded his national side to a large extent. Despite his efforts, he was unsuccessful in helping Liberia qualify for a single FIFA World Cup, falling just a point short in qualifying for the 2002 tournament. However, he did help Liberia to qualify for the African Cup of Nations on two occasions: Weah represented his country in the 1996 and 2002 editions of the tournament, although Liberia failed to make it out of their group both times, suffering first-round eliminations.Weah has been named by several media outlets as one of the best players to never play at the World Cup.\nOne of the greatest African players of all time, George Weah was, like his namesake George Best before him, hamstrung in World Cup terms by hailing from a global minnow.\nWeah returned to the national team for a specially arranged friendly against Nigeria on 11 September 2018, his final international appearance, playing at the age of 51 while in office as the country's president. His number 14 shirt, worn at his playing peak, was retired after the friendly, with Weah receiving a standing ovation when he was substituted.\nWeah has four children; three children with his Jamaican-born wife Clar Weah: George, Tita, and Timothy and a child from another relationship. In 2016, he was sued by the mother of his daughter for child support expenses.\nBoth of his sons became footballers and signed for Paris Saint-Germain, although only Timothy played for the first team. Both played youth internationals for the United States, and Timothy was capped for the senior team.Weah practiced Islam for ten years before converting back to Christianity. Currently, Weah again practices Protestantism. In October 2017, he was spotted in the prominent Nigerian church of Pastor T.B. Joshua alongside Liberian Senator Prince Yormie Johnson. Joshua was allegedly a key influence in Johnson's decision to endorse Weah's candidacy in the 2017 Liberian elections.He holds French citizenship and speaks the French language fluently.\n"

At 17 he signed professional forms for Wolverhampton Wanderers, but was unable to break through to the first team, and in 1970 moved back home to join Darlington in the Fourth Division. After 18 months he was transferred to Second Division side Hull City. He established himself as first choice goalkeeper a year later, and starting from the 1973\u201374 season missed only three games in four years. Injury restricted his appearances in the next season, when Hull were relegated to the Third Division.In July 1979 Wealands joined Birmingham City, then in the Second Division, for a fee of \u00a330,000. His first season at Birmingham saw them promoted to the First Division. He kept 16 clean sheets and was chosen Player of the Year. He kept his place as first choice goalkeeper, despite competition from promising youngster Tony Coton, and played more than 100 games before a difference of views with new manager Ron Saunders saw him out of contention. He joined Manchester United as cover for Gary Bailey, initially on loan, in 1983, and was an unused substitute in the 1983 FA Charity Shield, but a recurring back injury restricted his chances. Periods on loan at Oldham Athletic and Preston North End preceded his leaving the Football League altogether to join Altrincham in the Alliance Premier League (soon to be renamed the Football Conference).Wealands' first season at Altrincham brought considerable success, culminating in a trip to Wembley where the club beat Runcorn 1\u20130 to win the 1985\u201386 FA Trophy. In that season's FA Cup, Altrincham reached the Third Round and were drawn away to Birmingham City, still in the First Division and still managed by Saunders. Wealands helped his new club become only the second non-league team to eliminate top-flight opponents on their own ground when they won 2\u20131, a result which gave the player considerable personal satisfaction, and which was followed two days later by Saunders' resignation. The next season Wealands helped the club reach the final of the Cheshire Senior Cup. He then had a spell at Barrow before returning to Altrincham in 1988. The last of his 273 games in all competitions for the club was in 1992, by which time he was 41 years old.After finally retiring from playing, he served briefly on the board of Altrincham, and has coached goalkeepers at Bury. In his early days with Altrincham he worked in insurance, and later was involved with a property development company.\n"

She <<<started collecting vintage clothing at age 15>>> and later attended the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, where she took architecture classes, and obtained her bachelor's degree in interior and graphic design. While paying her way through college by waitressing, she held internships at the design firms Cambridge Seven Associates in Boston and Milton Glaser in New York.Wearstler moved to Los Angeles in her mid-twenties, hoping to work in the film industry as a set decorator. In 1992 she was a production assistant on HouseSitter, and the following year she served as an uncredited assistant art director on So I Married an Axe Murderer. After working small roles on several sets she decided not to pursue a film career, though the experience did lead to an interior design commission from a film producer. While working as a hostess at a Beverly Hills restaurant in 1994, she was scouted by a Playboy photographer and was featured as September Playmate of the Month under the name Kelly Gallagher. She used the money from the photoshoot to pay off student loans and help start her interior design business.\nIn 1995 Wearstler opened Kelly Wearstler Interior Design, her own design firm. The following year she was introduced to real estate developer Brad Korzen, who hired her to design his house in the Hollywood Hills and several residential properties owned by Korzen's company Kor Realty Group.  The first of the residences was the Avalon hotel in Beverly Hills, which re-opened in 1999 with a style described in the press as \"a playful take on mid-century modernism.\" With apartments filled with pieces from modernist artists such as Arne Jacobsen, Eero Saarinen and George Nelson, The New York Times would write a decade later that \"her playful, elegantly over-the-top designs for the Avalon Beverly Hills changed the look of boutique hotels around the world.\" In 2000, she designed the small Maison 140 hotel in Beverly Hills.Her work on the Avalon and the Maison 140 led to a commission designing Viceroy Hotels and Resorts, a new chain of boutique hotels, which she gave an \"almost theatrical\" Hollywood aesthetic.  The Viceroy in Palm Springs became \"her most accomplished work\" in 2001, and the design of the Viceroy that opened a year later in Santa Monica also earning praise in the press. By that time she was also working on the Viceroy Miami, and other notable designs include Viceroy Anguilla on the island of Anguilla and The Tides Hotel South Beach in Miami. Elle Decor  would later write that \"her luxury hotel interiors\" featured \"elegant berg\u00e8re chairs, unexpected lacquer finishes (glistening lemon yellows, Amazon parrot greens) and old-style stately wallpapers.\"  As of 2002 she had also completed design projects for clients such as Mercury Records, Ben Stiller, and Jeanne Tripplehorn. In 2006 Wearstler designed the restaurant and lounge, BG Restaurant, at the Manhattan Bergdorf Goodman department store.\nHer clothing is no longer sold at Bergdorf Goodman or related retailers, as Wearstler no longer has a fashion collection, instead focusing on furniture, lighting, textiles and accessories sold at her flagship store and website. She continued to operate her Los Angeles boutique as of July 2015, with Architectural Digest writing at the time that the store \"showcases the breadth and daring of her creative output.\" The store contains antique and modern pieces, as well as home furnishings and jewelry designed by Wearstler.As of 2015 she was involved in a number of collaborations and designing lamps with the Italian furniture company Kartell.

Opined Wallpaper*, \"all the pieces are imbued with personality. From the brushed copper through to the walnut that coats the inside of the furniture pieces, a particular ardour resides in the wares.\" In June 2016 Wearstler launched a new bridal registry featuring designer products for the home. Also in June 2016, Elle Decor named her to its A-List of the world's best designers for the second year in a row. In 2016, Wearstler was also the interior designer in charge of remodeling the restaurant Viviane, located in the Avalon Hotel in Beverly Hills. In the same year, she designed a New York home for former Bare Escentuals CEO Leslie Blodgett.In 2017, Wearstler's Malibu home was photographed for Melanie Acevedo's photobook The Authentics. In September 2017, Wearstler completed the interior design of the first Proper hotel in San Francisco.In 2018, Wearstler also debuted her first retail project design, a chocolate shop in Los Angeles called Compart\u00e9s Chocolatier, created in partnership with Jonathan Graham.In 2019, Wearstler was the first American designer to collaborate with Georg Jensen on a six-piece home accessories collection called \"Frequency.\" In May 2019, Wearstler announced she had designed a new collection of carpets as part of her continuing collaboration with The Rug Company. In June 2019, Wearstler launched a new line of wallpaper designs. The Santa Monica Proper Hotel with an interior designed by Wearstler also opened in July 2019.

Garbutt, co-founder of Famous Players-Lasky, which later became Paramount Pictures. At one point, the house was also owned by Carroll O\u2019Connor.In March 2020, Wearstler became the first instructor to teach the interior design course on the MasterClass platform. In 2021, Wearstler collaborated with Farrow & Ball to create her own collection of signature paint hues inspired by the state of California, called the California Collection.In March 2021, Wearstler also designed a virtual garage to commemorate the launch of GMC's Hummer EV, which she said was imagined for LeBron James.In 2021, Wearstler invested in the company Block Renovation, which provides a technology based platform that helps homeowners and contractors to digitize and simplify the home renovation process. In early 2022, she became an investor and partner of the female-founded tequila brand Casa Del Sol, which was co-founded by actor Eva Longoria.

Her works are often inspired by true events, many of which took place in the areas where Weatherford has lived. In her Author's Notes for each book, she includes a portion of the historical research from which her fiction or poetry emerged. In describing her purpose for writing to School Library Journal, in a 2008 interview, she said: \"I want the books that I write that are set during the Jim Crow era and the Civil Rights era to nudge today's kids toward justice.

After graduation, she lived and worked in New York where in 1985 she was a Helena Rubinstein Fellow in the Independent Study Program of the Whitney Museum of American Art.  She returned to Southern California in 1999 and later received an M.F.A. from the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard College. Early in her career she also collaborated with her late sister, the writer Margaret Weatherford, on performance art and worked as a bookkeeper for the artist Mike Kelley.A career breakthrough came in 2012 with Weatherford's Bakersfield Project exhibition at the Todd Madigan Gallery at California State University at Bakersfield where she was an artist in residence. The Bakersfield paintings marked the first time she incorporated illuminated neon light tubes into her abstract paintings. The series was inspired by the colourful neon signs she saw on old restaurant and factory buildings while driving around Bakersfield.Weatherford used neon in the Bakersfield Project and later series of paintings, such as Manhattan (2013), Los Angeles (2014) and Train Yard (2016\u20132020) to recreate the sensations of specific places or moments. In an interview for Gagosian Quarterly she once said,  \u2018I try to depict or deliver not only a visual translation of a place in time, but with that, the scent, the sound, and the feeling. Is it chilly? Is it hot? Is there a clanging sound?\u2019Her work was included in the exhibitions Variations: Conversations in and Around Abstract Painting at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2014. That same year she received the $25,000 Artist Award from the Artists' Legacy Foundation founded by Viola Frey. Examples of Weatherford's abstract paintings incorporating neon lights are held by the Museum of Modern Art, the Hirshhorn Museum, and the Hammer Museum. Another of her neon paintings, Past Sunset (2015), was shown at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in the 2016 exhibition NO MAN'S LAND: Women Artists from the Rubell Family Collection.

            "early_life": "Weathers was born January 14, 1948, in New Orleans, Louisiana. His father was a day laborer. As an eighth-grade student, he earned an athletic scholarship to St. Augustine High School, a private school. He was an all-around athlete, involved in boxing, football, gymnastics, judo, soccer, and wrestling. He played football and graduated from Long Beach Poly high in 1966.\nWeathers played football as a defensive end in college. He started his college career in 1966 at Long Beach City College, where he did not play in 1966 due to an ankle injury suffered when he tripped over a curb surrounding the running track while warming up for practice with another linebacker. He then transferred and played for San Diego State University, becoming a letterman for the San Diego State Aztecs in 1968 and 1969, helping the Aztecs win the 1969 Pasadena Bowl, finishing with an 11\u20130 record, and a No. 18 ranking in the Final UPI Poll, playing for head coach Don Coryell. At San Diego State, Weathers <<<received a master in theatre arts>>>.\nAfter he went undrafted, Weathers signed with the Oakland Raiders as a free agent in 1970. Now playing as a linebacker, Weathers played in seven games for the Raiders in 1970, helping them win the  AFC West Division title, on their way to the first-ever AFC Championship Game.

During the 2017 NFL Draft, he appeared on NFL Network's pre-draft coverage.\nWeathers began working as an extra while still playing football. He had his first significant roles in two blaxploitation films directed by his longtime friend Arthur Marks: Bucktown (1975) and Friday Foster (1975). Weathers also appeared in an early 1975 episode of the sitcom Good Times titled \"The Nude\", portraying an angry husband who suspected his wife of cheating on him with J.J. He also guest-starred in a 1975 episode of Kung Fu titled \"The Brothers Caine\", and in an episode of Cannon titled \"The Hero\". In 1976, he appeared as a loan shark in an episode of the crime-drama Starsky and Hutch, and in the Barnaby Jones episode \"The Bounty Hunter\" as escaped convict Jack Hopper.\nWhile auditioning for the role of Apollo Creed alongside Sylvester Stallone in Rocky, Weathers criticized Stallone's acting, which led to him getting the role.

Mr. T and Lundgren agreed, but Weathers wanted an actual part in the movie, even though his character had died in Rocky IV. Stallone refused, and Weathers decided not to allow Stallone to use his image for flashbacks from the previous films. They instead used footage of a fighter who looks similar to Weathers. Weathers and Stallone patched up their differences and Weathers agreed to allow footage of him from previous films to be used throughout Creed.Weathers portrayed the father of Michael Strahan and Daryl \"Chill\" Mitchell's characters on the short-lived 2009 Fox sitcom Brothers.

She completed a B.A. in English at Albion College,<<< M.F.S. in Forest Science>>> at Yale University, and <<<Ph.D. in Ecology>>> at Rutgers University. Her early research, published in Nature, was one of the first studies to show that fog, in addition to rain, can contribute to acid pollution to forests.\nWeathers is an ecosystem ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, where she has spent most of her research career. Her research interests are broad and she has made significant contributions to our understanding of atmospheric ecology, terrestrial ecology, and aquatic ecology. To date, Weathers has written or contributed to over 200 peer-reviewed articles, which have received over 13,000 citations. Her research is focused on understanding of how air-water-land interactions affect ecosystem functioning. For example, she has worked with colleagues to quantify how fog and precipitation can both provide critical nutrients to forest ecosystems, but also harmful pollutants. Other notable research has studied the effects of storms on lake water quality and coupled human-ecosystem interactions.She is the lead editor of the foundational textbook Fundamentals of Ecosystem Science with David Strayer and Gene Likens. In addition to co-authoring the textbook, Weathers has led multiple synthesis efforts in ecosystem science, including setting a research agenda for the discipline.Weathers has taken many leadership roles within the ecological community that have informed policy. Weathers is the current (elected) President of the Ecological Society of America (2020-2021) and was the elected Chair of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (2011-2012). She served on the EPA Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee from 2009-2015 and was on the National Academy of Sciences' National Transportation Board Committee to evaluate the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program during 2000-2002.Weathers was the elected Co-Chair of the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) from 2011-2018, where she led the 800-person grassroots network in developing a new training model for graduate students and team science approaches for scientific working groups. Weathers' training model is to explicitly empower early career scientists to take leadership roles in collaborative research projects. Under Weathers' guidance, early career GLEON researchers have led many collaborative projects, including studies on how road salt and climate change affect lakes.In addition to leading international research networks and scientific societies, Weathers is the Research Director of the Lake Sunapee Protective Association, where she facilitates scientific engagement between the public and researchers. As part of this role, Weathers has catalyzed multiple research studies on Lake Sunapee, which has led to new understanding on the sensitivity of low-nutrient lakes to land use change and cyanobacterial blooms. Weathers also serves on the Mohonk Preserve Board of Directors, currently as its Vice Chair, and is a long-time member of the Mohonk Preserve Conservation Science Committee, currently serving as its Chair (as of Fall 2020).\n"

Instead, it engages only with the positive aspects \u2013 the boot-knocking inherent sexiness of cowboys; the hard work of maintaining a ranch; and the natural ethos of family and community.\" A television series adaptation is in development by Valerie C.

            "early_life": "Born in Pineland, Texas, Weatherspoon <<<was a health and physical education major and star basketball player>>> at Louisiana Tech. In 1988, her senior season, she led the Lady Techsters to the NCAA national title. After college, Weatherspoon played overseas in Italy, France and Russia for 8 years.\nWeatherspoon is one of the original players of the WNBA in 1997 when she joined the New York Liberty in the WNBA's inaugural season. A talented ball-handler and charismatic leader, her energetic play quickly endeared her to the fans and media in New York. In 1997 she was the first winner of the league's Defensive Player of the Year Award. She won the title again in 1998.\nDuring the 1999 WNBA Finals, Weatherspoon had one of the most memorable feats in WNBA history; in Game 2 on September 4, 1999 the Liberty were down 67\u201365 against the Houston Comets with no timeouts left and 2.4 seconds left on the game clock after a shot made by Tina Thompson. After receiving the inbound pass, Weatherspoon dribbled the ball up to half court and made a game-winning shot 50 feet away from the basket to force a Game 3. That moment would later be referred to as \"The Shot\". Up until the 2003 season, she held the distinction of being the only WNBA player to start every one of her games. After the 2003 season, she was not re-signed by the Liberty and signed with the Los Angeles Sparks.\nWeatherspoon's final WNBA game ever was Game 2 of the 2004 Western Conference First Round on September 26, 2004 against the Sacramento Monarchs. The Sparks won the game 71 - 57 and evened the series 1 - 1 with Weatherspoon recording 2 rebounds in 3 minutes. However, Weatherspoon did not play in Game 3 and the Sparks lost that game 58 - 73 and were eliminated from the playoffs. After her 2004 season with the Sparks, Weatherspoon retired.\nIn 2007 Weatherspoon was the head coach of the Westchester Phantoms of the American Basketball Association.  In April 2008 she joined the coaching staff of the Lady Techsters of Louisiana Tech.  On February 9, 2009, she was promoted to interim head coach to replace former head coach Chris Long. April 2, 2009 saw Louisiana Tech shed the interim label and name Teresa head women's basketball coach. In 2011, she was voted in by fans as one of the Top 15 players in the fifteen-year history of the WNBA. In 2016, Weatherspoon was named in the WNBA Top 20@20. On September 26, 2019, Weatherspoon was named two-way player development coach for the New Orleans Pelicans. Weatherspoon was later promoted to a full-time assistant coach for the Pelicans on November 16, 2020. The Pelicans released Weatherspoon from the coaching staff in June 2023.\nWeatherspoon was selected to represent the US at the inaugural Goodwill games, held in Moscow in July 1986. North Carolina State's Kay Yow served as head coach. The team opened up with a 72\u201353 of Yugoslavia, and followed that with a 21-point win over Brazil 91\u201370. The third game was against Czechoslovakia and would be much closer, ending in a 78\u201370 victory. The USA faced Bulgaria in the semi-final match up, and again won, this time 67\u201358. This set up the final against the Soviet Union, led by 7-foot-2 Ivilana Semenova, considered the most dominant player in the world. The Soviet team, had a 152\u20132 record in major international competition over the prior three decades, including an 84\u201382 win over the US in the 1983 World Championships. The Soviets held the early edge, leading 21\u201319 at one time, before the USA went on a scoring run to take a large lead they would never relinquish. The final score was 83\u201360 in favor of the US, earning the gold medal for the USA squad. For the entire event, Teresa Gaye Weatherspoon averaged 1.6 points per game.Weatherspoon continued with the National team at the 1986 World Championship, held in Moscow, a month after the Goodwill games in Moscow, although she was injured and unable to play. The USA team was even more dominant this time. The early games were won easily, and the semifinal against Canada, while the closest game for the USA so far, ended up an 82\u201359 victory.  At the same time, the Soviet team was winning easily as well, and the final game pitted two teams each with 6\u20130 records. The Soviet team, having lost only once at home, wanted to show that the Goodwill games setback was a fluke. The USA team started by scoring the first eight points, and raced to a 45\u201323 lead, although the Soviets fought back and reduced the halftime margin to 13. The USA went on a 15\u20131 run in the second half to put the game away, and ended up winning the gold medal with a score of 108\u201388.Weatherspoon was selected to be a member of the team representing the US at the 1987 World University Games held in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. The USA team won four of the five contests.  After winning their first two games against Poland and Finland, the USA faced the host team Yugoslavia. The game went to overtime, but Yugoslavia prevailed, 93\u201389. The USA faced China in the next game. They won 84\u201383, but they needed to win by at least five points to remain in medal contention. They won the final game against Canada to secure fifth place. Weatherspoon averaged 8.6 points per games. She recorded 21 steals over the course of the event, tied for first place on the team.\nWeatherspoon was born to Charles and Rowena Weatherspoon in Pineland, Texas. Her father, Charles Sr., played minor league baseball in the Minnesota Twins' farm system, and holds the record for the most grand slams (3) in a minor league game. Weatherspoon has two brothers and three sisters. She credits her family, especially her mother Rowena Weatherspoon, as the biggest influence on her basketball career.

            "early_life": "Born in Heswall, Cheshire, Woan started his career in 1985 at Everton but never made a start for the then First Division club. He <<<spent five years playing in the lower leagues>>>, including spells at Heswall, Welsh sides Caernarfon Town and Newtown, and Runcorn. His big break came, aged 22, when on 14 March 1990 he joined first division side Nottingham Forest for a fee of \u00a380,000.\nUpon leaving Forest in 2000, and after a short trial with Bolton Wanderers, Woan signed for Swindon Town and in the 2000/01 season, producing three goals from 25 appearances.\nA year later Woan found himself joining American team Columbus Crew. Married to an American wife, the then 33-year-old winger endured a difficult season in Major League Soccer with the team winning just two of their eight opening matches. This led to the replacing of manager Tom Fitzgerald, the man who had secured Woan's contract in America.\nAt the end of the season, Woan was traded to the Miami Fusion and finished his MLS career with them.In 2002, Woan returned to England and signed for struggling Shrewsbury Town, who were at the bottom of the Third Division. Woan teamed up with ex-Forest striker Nigel Jemson and the pair notably inspired the Shrews to one of their greatest ever results. The Shropshire outfit defeated Everton \u2013 who featured a young Wayne Rooney \u2013 in January 2003 in the third round of the FA Cup, with Jemson scoring twice. It was Woan's last minute cross that ensured the Premier League side's fate, but the Shrews were knocked out of the competition 4\u20130 by Chelsea the next round in a televised match. Shrewsbury were relegated that season and Woan returned to America.\nWoan then joined the Syracuse Salty Dogs of the A-League (the U.S. second tier) and competed in another season in the States before deciding to return to England.\nWoan headed back to Swindon Town, taking charge of the under 18 side at the County Ground until deciding to move to Rushden & Diamonds as first team coach for Paul Hart in July 2006. Following the sacking of Hart later on in 2006, Woan then returned to Nottingham Forest, charged with coaching some of the youngsters coming through the Forest Academy. In March 2007 he was signed for Hucknall Town by one-time teammate Andy Legg, but didn't play in any games.\nOn 7 July 2007, Premier League outfit Portsmouth announced that Woan had joined as coach of their Under-18s. In November 2009, he was appointed joint caretaker manager at Portsmouth along with Paul Groves, following the dismissal of Hart. His appointment only lasted several days, and he moved aside for the arrival of Avram Grant as the full-time manager.\nIn the summer of 2010, following the departure of Grant to West Ham United and the appointment of Steve Cotterill as the new Portsmouth manager, Woan was appointed first team coach. In June 2011, he joined Watford as assistant manager.\nIn the summer of 2012, Woan and Tony Loughlan departed Watford after Gianfranco Zola's appointment as manager.\nOn 30 October 2012, Woan linked up with former management partner Sean Dyche at Burnley. Woan was dismissed along with Dyche on 15 April 2022.On 30th January 2023, Woan was appointed assistant manager of Everton.\nHe is the son of Alan Woan who also played professionally, most notably for Northampton Town, Crystal Palace and Aldershot.\n"

            "early_life": "Wardle was born in Stepney, East London, His father, Harry Eugene Wardle, worked as a postman, while his mother, Kathleen Bridget (n\u00e9e Fitzgibbon), was a school and County Hall secretary. Wobble grew up with his family in Whitechapel's Clichy Estate in London's East End. He is a long-time friend of John Lydon (Johnny Rotten) whom he had met in the 1970s at London's Kingsway College. The two formed half of the group of friends known as \"The Four Johns\", along with John Grey and John Simon Ritchie (later known as Sid Vicious). Jah Wobble acquired his stage name through the drunken, mumbled version of Wardle's name by Sid Vicious, which Wobble kept because \"people would never forget it\".\nIn his early life and career, by his own admission, Wardle was given to occasional bouts of aggression, exacerbated by heavy drinking and drug use. As a result, he ended up living in a squat with John Gray in West London, whilst Lydon formed The Sex Pistols. With admittedly large \"builders hands\", he had experimented with the guitar, but found playing bass a more connected and whole body experience, influenced in part by admiring Bob Marley's and The Wailers bassist Aston \"Family Man\" Barrett on stage in 1975. Wardle was as critical of his friend Vicious's bass playing as John Lydon, and had hence played in experimentation sessions with Lydon. After he burned the furniture of his squat-mates in order to stay warm, they left him alone there with a mattress, a headboard and his Music Man-copy bass.\nSoon after leaving PiL, Wobble formed The Human Condition with guitarist Dave \"Animal\" Maltby and PiL's original drummer, Jim Walker. The Human Condition toured the UK, Europe, and US in 1981, and made two cassette-only releases of their live shows (Live at the Collegiate Theatre and Live in Europe). The post-PiL years saw Wobble also collaborating with Can members Holger Czukay and Jaki Liebezeit on Czukay's solo projects (notably On the Way to the Peak of Normal and Rome Remains Rome) and Full Circle (released in 1984).In 1983, Wardle appeared on the LP Snake Charmer billed as a co-leader alongside guitarist The Edge of U2, Czukay, Liebezeit, and producer Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian.Jah Wobble's Invaders of the Heart was formed in 1982. The original line-up was Ollie Marland on keys (who went on to become Tina Turner's musical director), Annie Whitehead on trombone, Neville Murray on percussion and a musician named only as Cliff, on drums. By 1983 Lee Partis was the drummer. Trumpeter Harry Beckett and pedal steel player B. J. Cole regularly performed with the group.By 1985 Jah Wobble's heavy drinking and drunken brawls were having an effect on his life. Halfway through the recording of the album Psalms (October 1986), Wobble stopped drinking. From then through to the present day he has remained 'clean and sober'.He then did a variety of day jobs, whilst continuing to perform and record his music in what spare time he had. These jobs included a long stretch with the London Underground. In an oft-quoted tale, it is related that he once, at Tower Hill Underground Station via the public address system, regaled commuters with the deadpan announcement, \"I used to be somebody. I repeat, I used to be somebody.\"By 1987, due to the repeated prompting of his friend and former bandmate, percussionist Neville Murray, Wobble reformed The Invaders of the Heart. Armed with a live recording of a concert he had made with a new line-up of musicians during a European tour in 1988, Wobble travelled to New York City's New Music Seminar in 1989 to get back into the music industry. Wobble was able to secure an eleventh-hour record deal with a small European record label. The live album, Without Judgement, recorded in the Netherlands was released in November 1989 and successfully revived Wobble's career.\nFollowing the success of Jah Wobble's Invaders of the Heart albums Without Judgement in 1990 and Rising Above Bedlam in 1991, Wobble has collaborated with many musicians - Brian Eno among them - & his explorations into world music predated much of the genre's popularity. Jah Wobble's 1994 album Take Me To God was influenced by world music genres and contributions from a variety of artists of diverse cultural backgrounds, including Baaba Maal, Dolores O'Riordan, and Chaka Demus, and was a critical and commercial success. His music has spanned a number of genres, including ambient music and dance music, and in 2003, reworkings of traditional English folk songs. Although he has released recordings since the late seventies Wobble has been particularly prolific from the mid-1990s to the present. He now runs his own label, 30 Hertz Records, and tours regularly throughout the UK and Europe with his current band, Jah Wobble & The Invaders of the Heart.\nWobble was part of the industrial music supergroup The Damage Manual, which formed in 2000 and consisted of Wobble on bass alongside former PiL and Killing Joke drummer Martin Atkins, Killing Joke guitarist Geordie Walker, and vocalist Chris Connelly (who had previously worked with Atkins as part of two other industrial music supergroups, Pigface and Murder Inc., the latter of which also featured Walker). He appeared on the group's self-titled debut album as well as the EP One, both of which were released on Atkins' Invisible Records label, but subsequently left the group after declining to participate in their tour of the U.S.\nA collaboration with his wife, the Chinese-born guzheng player Zi Lan Liao, was entitled Chinese Dub. He also performed at the 2008 Rhythm Festival.\nJah Wobble and the Chinese Dub Orchestra won the Cross-Cultural Collaboration category, for their album Chinese Dub, in the inaugural Songlines Music Awards, announced on 1 May 2009, which were the new world music awards organised by the UK based magazine, Songlines.\nIn September 2009, John Lydon reformed PiL for a series of concerts in late 2009. Despite Lydon's invitation to join, Jah Wobble did not feature in the line-up, since he considered the wages offered insufficient and disagreed with the choice of venues.At an impromptu appearance at the Musicport Festival in Bridlington Spa on 24 October 2010, where they were joined by vocalist Johnny Rotter of the Sex Pistols Experience, Wobble renewed his association with former PiL guitarist Keith Levene.\nIn 2011, Wobble collaborated with Julie Campbell, alias Warp Records artist LoneLady in a project called Psychic Life. The eponymous debut album Psychic Life was inspired by disco, post-punk and psychogeography, and released by Cherry Red Records on 14 November 2011. Keith Levene contributed to three tracks on the album. A digital-only EP, Psychic Life, fronted by the song \"Tightrope\", was released in October 2011.\nIn early 2012, after some planned Japan gigs were cancelled because of visa issues, Wobble and Levene played various UK clubs as Metal Box in Dub.  The visa issues were resolved and they played Fuji Rock festival in July 2012. This was followed by the release of a four-song, eponymous EP. An album entitled Yin & Yang was released in November 2012.Wobble has also collaborated with the British ambient group Marconi Union, the results of which were released as an album called Anomic on 30 Hertz records in June 2013. In October 2013, 30 Hertz Records released Odds & Sods & Epilogues, an illustrated book/CD of Jah Wobble's poetry.\nIn 2015, Cherry Red Records released Redux, a six-CD box set that spans nearly four decades of Wobble's music. It includes new tracks Merry Go Round and Let's Go Psycho. In May 2015, Jah Wobble & The Invaders of the Heart embarked on an extensive six-month UK tour. They recorded the album The Usual Suspects which was released on 3m Music in 2017. A series of gigs in England from January to May 2017 was announced.\nWobble has four children:  including music producer Natalie Wardle from his first marriage, and two sons with his second wife, the Chinese-born guzheng player and harpist Zi Lan Liao.\n"

            "early_life": "Wodening grew up with her brother Jack Collom in Western Springs, Illinois. She married Stan Brakhage in 1957. Before marrying Brakhage, she was studying to be a zoologist. On her reason for dropping out, Wodening said:<<<I quit school because I was unpopular. I was not the norm, even though I really tried>>>. I wore the right clothes, and I washed myself, I took baths and shaved my armpits, and\u2014oh! The things I did. But it didn't work, none of it worked. I was just weird. I didn't say the right things, I didn't look in the right direction. Out of it, I've always been out of it.<<<During their marriage, she was featured in one of Brakhage's best-known works, the experimental short film>>> Window Water Baby Moving. In the film, her husband films her giving birth. Critic Archer Winsten described the film as being \"so forthright, so full of primitive wonder and love, so far beyond civilization in its acceptance that it becomes an experience like few in the history of movies.\" The Academy Film Archive preserved Window Water Baby Moving in 2013.She later featured in another \"birth film\" filmed by Brakhage, called Thigh Line Lyre Triangular (1961), though this film was less critically acclaimed. Wodening is also featured in several other acclaimed works, many of which she played a significant role in the actual making of (directing, photographing, and editing), such as Cats Cradle (1959), Wedlock House: An Intercourse (1959), and Dog Star Man (1961-64).\n\nBrakhage and Wodening have both stated that she played a large role in Brakhage's career. In an interview once, Brakhage is quoted as having said, \"'By Brakhage' should be understood to mean 'by way of Stan and Jane Brakhage,' as it does in all my films since marriage. It is coming to mean: 'by way of Stan and Jane and all the children Brakhage.'\" Wodening has reiterated this as well saying: And so, this point of contention about, was I a partner in Stan's work. Stan said so, over and over again, from the stage. And that's interesting. . . . So, I'll see what I can say, but what I'm speaking from is: I was working on the films.While Wodening was married to Brakhage, experimental filmaker and feminist Barbara Hammer made a short documentary about her titled Jane Brakhage. Released in 1974, the film takes an intimate look at her life and features prominent voice-over of Wodening discussing her views on life, nature, philosophy, and being a housewife. Interestingly, in order to more directly focus on Wodening's life, Hammer chose not to include any footage, or mention, of Brakhage (whose work she admired) in the documentary. Initially the film was meant to act as Hammer's masters thesis film for San Francisco State University but it was rejected.\nAfter almost 30 years of marriage, Brakhage separated from Wodening in 1986, and the divorce was finalized a year later. She subsequently lived in her car for two years and drove all over America, creating the book Driveabout. Later, she lived alone in a tiny cabin at 10,000 feet elevation in the Rocky Mountains, creating another book Living Up There while getting out several collections of short stories.In 2004, she moved to Denver, Colorado and continued writing books, such as Wolf Dictionary, The Lady Orangutan and Other Stories,  Animals I've Neglected to Mention, and Brakhage\u2019s Childhood.\n"

Moving from graffiti art to the studio in 2000 Woehr started to experiment with painting on canvas and constructing sculptural dioramas. Working in these modes of expression Woehr sought to capture the dynamism of the urban experience and environment. Recognized for his artistic talent in 2010 Woehr was chosen, along with four other artists, to represent Germany in the Fine Art international art exhibition, an arts initiative and traveling exhibition created to celebrate the FIFA World Cup of the same year.\nIn 2013 Woehr sought new means to treat the city, his urban subject matter. His abstract images depict a bird's eye view, a vision which represents the fundamental essence of an urban experience Woehr eschews realistic depictions, alternatively restructuring and reshaping the streets and architecture of a particular city he has visited in a style reminiscent of the Russian Constructivists, like Kazimir Malevich, El Lissitzky, Vladimir Tatlin and the artists of the Bauhaus such as L\u00e1szlo Moholy-Nagy, from whom he draws inspiration. By titling each work with a location's geographic or GPS coordinates, Woehr invites viewer participation, research and exploration of the subject city. While each work is a translation of the artist's personal connection with a particular city, the receding dimensionality of each multi-layer image leaves the viewer a conceptual space for her own interpretation. Although he works primarily in the studio, Woehr remains close to the urban landscape continuing to paint outside on city walls, buildings, trains and large-scale sculptures. These works achieve the same objectives as his sculptural reliefs, as he crafts the illusion of the three-dimensional space in these painted constructions. Painted on a monumental scale this work envelops the viewer, inviting her into a newly conceived urban environment and experience.\n"

In 1988, she graduated from Southwest University for Nationalities in Chengdu with <<<a degree in Chinese literature>>>. She <<<worked as a reporter>>> in Kardz\u00e9 and later in Lhasa and has lived in Beijing since 2003 as a result of political problems. Woeser is married to Wang Lixiong, a renowned author who frequently writes about Tibet. According to Reporters sans fronti\u00e8res, \"Woeser is one of the few Tibetan authors and poets to write in Chinese.\" When the government refused to give her a passport, she sued the authorities.\nWoeser is the author of the book, Notes on Tibet (\u897f\u85cf\u7b14\u8bb0; X\u012bz\u00e0ng B\u01d0j\u00ec). The Tibet Information Network quotes unnamed sources that the book was banned by the government around September 2003.According to UNPO, shortly after the alleged ban, Woeser was also fired from her job and lost her status with her work unit. Radio Free Asia reported that she continued to post a variety of poems and articles to her two blogs: Maroon Map (\u7edb\u7ea2\u8272\u7684\u5730\u56fe, oser.tibetcul.net), which, according to the author, was visited primarily by Tibetans and the Woeser blog (blog.daqi.com/weise), which was visited primarily by those of Han ethnicity. According to RFA, on July 28, 2006, both blogs were closed by order of the government, apparently in response to postings in which she expressed birthday greetings to the Dalai Lama and touched on other sensitive topics. Woeser stated that she would continue writing and speaking.\n\nDuring the Tibetan unrest of 2008, Woeser and her husband were put under house arrest after speaking to reporters. In December 2008, Woeser and her husband were among the first of the original 303 signatories to Charter 08, now joined by thousands more. Liu Xiaobo, the author of Charter 08, was sentenced for eleven years of prison and awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. In July 2009, Woeser and her husband were one of more than 100 signatories to a petition asking Chinese authorities to release detained ethnic-Uyghur professor of economics Ilham Tohti. When she was honoured with the Prince Claus Awards in 2011, she was forbidden to receive the prize in the Dutch embassy.Tsering Woeser defended Tibetan actions in the 1905 Tibetan Rebellion, saying that Zhao Erfeng invaded the region to  \"brutally stop Tibetan protests\", listing atrocities committed by Zhao.Woeser's writings are regularly translated into English by the translations website High Peaks Pure Earth.\n"

            "early_life": "After graduation from forestry school in Rottenburg am Neckar, he <<<took up a job as a government wood ranger>>> in the Rhineland-Palatinate in 1987. As he <<<grew more familiar with the woodlands he was overseeing, he became disenchanted due to the damage caused by the techniques and technologies he was expected to employ>>>, including the felling of mature trees and the use of insecticides.Professionally, Wohlleben manages a beech forest on behalf of the municipality of H\u00fcmmel, Germany. He <<<offers regular forest tours>>> at his forest academy.Wohlleben advocates for animal welfare and has raised awareness about the treatment of animals. He has controversially argued that plants feel pain and has stated that \"It's okay to eat plants. It's okay to eat meat, although I'm a vegetarian, because meat is the main forest killer. But if plants are conscious about what they are doing, it's okay to eat them. Because otherwise we will die. And it's our right to survive.\u201d\nWohlleben began publishing books popularizing scientific research about ecology and forest management in 2007. The appearance of his Das geheime Leben der B\u00e4ume through Random House's Ludwig imprint led to profiles and reviews in all the major German newspapers, including skeptical pieces in the business press. The book was featured in a cover story in Der Spiegel and appeared on the Spiegel bestseller list.His 2012 book Kranichflug und Blumenuhr, was translated as The Weather Detective: Rediscovering Nature's Secret Signs in 2018. The Secret Wisdom of Nature: Trees, Animals, and the Extraordinary Balance of All Living Things \u2013 Stories from Science and Observation was released in 2019. Wohlleben's first book for children available in English was published in October 2019. Called Can You Hear the Trees Talking?: Discovering The Hidden Life of Forests, it is a young readers' edition of The Hidden Life of Trees.\nHis 2015 book about natural forests, Das geheime Leben der B\u00e4ume:Was sie f\u00fchlen, wie sie kommunizieren \u2013 die Entdeckung einer verborgenen Welt, (The Hidden Life of Trees: What they Feel, How they Communicate: Discoveries from a Secret World) introduces readers to the world of trees, including Wood-Wide Web, through which nutrition and signals are exchanged among trees. An English translation was published in September 2016 under the title The Hidden Life of Trees: What they Feel, How they Communicate with a foreword by Australian environmentalist Tim Flannery, published by Greystone Books in partnership with the David Suzuki Institute. It cites the research of Suzanne Simard. The book was widely criticized by biologists and forest scientists for using strong anthropomorphic and teleological language such as describing trees as having friendships and registering fear, love and pain. It has been described as containing a \"conglomeration of half-truths, biased judgements, and wishful thinking\".A documentary film Intelligent Trees features several of Wohlleben's observations. He appears alongside Suzanne Simard, a professor of forest ecology at the University of British Columbia, who has been doing research on interactions among trees through micorrhizal networks since 1997.A second documentary film was released under the title The Hidden Life of Trees in theaters in the United States. It had its UK premiere at the 2021 Wales One World Film Festival, which was presented online owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2016, Wohlleben authored Das Seelenleben der Tiere, which was translated into English and published under the title The Inner Life of Animals: Love, Grief, and Compassion\u2014Surprising Observations of a Hidden World in 2017. The book argues for animal sentience. It contains 41 short chapters with examples of animals exhibiting emotions such as courage, desire, grief, love and regret.\n"

Previously, Brandenburg had two police headquarters, a state police and state unit of input. On 16 December 2010 the Brandenburg State Parliament approved the draft law on the merger of these authorities into a new police headquarters with effect from 1 January 2011.\n"

Their first break was being offered a position at MuchMusic in April 2010 as a Fashion Correspondent, where they worked for half a year. The same day that Wu was offered the position, they received an invitation to show their Fall Winter 2010 Collection at Vancouver Fashion Week. Wu was nineteen years old. They showed their very first time at Vancouver Fashion Week, which kick started their career as a fashion designer. Wu participated in the Spring-Summer 2011 Collection at the National Gallery of Canada during the Ottawa Fashion Week in October 2010. In the same month, they met Shawn Hewson of Project Runway Canada through the Alumni Association of Hillfield Strathallan College. Hewson mentored Wu for a year and introduced them to the Fashion Design Council of Canada. In 2009 artist Mehrnaz had illustrated a painting of one of Wu's earlier pieces.In November 2010, Wu was offered their first corporate collaboration, with The Allan Candy Co., based in Hamilton, Ontario. Wu was commissioned to create dresses out of Allan Candy wrappers for an online advertisement. This was the first time Allan Candy had collaborated with a fashion designer and used the advertisement to launch its DOPS candy line.Quickly known as the 18-year-old-boy who modelled their own dresses, Prestel published Wu internationally in a book called Style Diaries: World Fashion from Berlin to Tokyo in February 2011. The author, Simone Werle, featured Wu as \"one of the most influential forces behind tomorrow's trends\".In March 2011, R&B singer Keisha Chant\u00e9 modelled Wu's dress in the Dare to Wear Love Fashion Show.

Kruger planned to launch this \"White Cashmere Collection\" in September 2012. Wu became a spokesperson for Perrier as an official social influencer in 2012.\nIn 2015, Wu came out as neutrois, a non-binary gender identity, and started going by they/them pronouns. In the following year, Wu wrote an article on Medium explaining the concept of being non-binary and how it differs greatly from other transgender identities. They have since openly participated in the Trans Fusion drop-ins at the Sherbourne Health Centre in Toronto, advocating for the visibility of non-binary identities within the vast spectrum of gender diversity. During 2016, Wu posted video updates about their transition journey on their personal YouTube channel. By no later than December 2017, Wu changed their first name to Adrienne.In 2015, Wu began advocating with Toronto's Supporting Our Youth organization.\n"

            "early_life": "Wu was born in Suantou, Lioujiao\u2014literally \"Garlic Village\"\u2014in Chiayi County in south-central Taiwan. His father was a retired Taiwan Sugar Corporation worker and his mother a betel nut vendor, and he had two younger brothers who died in a car accident.  His nickname Wu Bai, meaning \"five hundred,\" derives from several stories, none of which can be proven to be fact: one story says the name came from his early academic success when he scored 100 points on each of five examination subjects when he was studying at middle school. However, an interest in music in his teenage years led to a decline in his academic performance and he failed to pass the university entrance examinations. Another story says he used to charge 500 Taiwan Dollars for his early concerts.\nWu left Chiayi County for the capital of Taipei in the late 1980s and worked in a number of menial jobs.  One of those jobs in a music shop led to the formation of his first band, Buzz, which soon broke up.Dean Zavolta describes the formation of Wu Bai & China Blue noting that the members originally \"played for different bands up until about 1991, after which [Chu Chien-hui] and I began jamming together with the eventual idea of forming a newer, fresher, and original rock band...Then one day, he called me up and asked me if I would mind filling in for a one-off gig with himself and a guitarist named Wu Bai...Something just clicked between us. Both the music and the mo chi (\u9ed8\u5951 \u2013 chemistry) we had were fantastic.  What really helped us though, was that when we first came out, Taiwan\u2014along with other Asian countries\u2014was ready for an Asian rock band that played live music.\"Wu debuted with two songs on the Taiwanese-language Dust of Angels Soundtrack in 1992 which were credited to his real name, Wu Chun-lin, and featured Chu Chien-hui and Dean Zavolta credited as China Blue.  The same year, Pony Canyon Taiwan released Wu's first album, Loving Others is a Happy Thing, a solo effort credited to Wu, and featuring each of the three other current China Blue members on at least one song but without the group being mentioned by name.  The 1993 soundtrack to Treasure Island featured Wu with the three members of China Blue designated as such.  All subsequent albums as of 2007 have been credited to Wu Bai & China Blue.\nIn 2003, Wu married Chen Wen-pey (\u9673\u6587\u73ee; Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: T\u00e2n B\u00fbn-p\u00f2e), his manager and girlfriend for over 10 years, in a private ceremony in Fukuoka, Japan.\nWu is an avid fan of Japanese pro wrestling, and has even written a theme song for his close friend, Keiji Mutoh.\n"

After graduation, he was employed as a worker and technician at Shanghai's No. 3 Electronic Tube Factory, and then deputy chief and chief of the technical section from 1976 to 1978. He would eventually go on to lead the factory as its party secretary. In 1978 he was assigned to become the deputy manager of Shanghai Electronic Elements Company, and between 1979 and 1981 the deputy manager of Shanghai Electron Tube Company. Between 1981 and 1983 he worked as the deputy secretary of Shanghai Meters, Instruments and Telecommunications Bureau.\nWu's work in electronics companies earned him a tenure in the city's upper echelons of power. He became part of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai party committee in 1983, effectively becoming part of Shanghai's political inner circle, and was put in charge of work related to science and technology. During this time, he worked with Jiang Zemin, who was mayor and later the CCP secretary of the city. Between 1985 and 1991, Wu was elevated to CCP deputy secretary of Shanghai, and subsequently as CCP secretary of Shanghai, succeeding Jiang.\nAs Shanghai's political and economic stature grew due to economic reforms, Wu gained a seat on the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, China's ruling council, in 1992. He was subsequently appointed as the third-ranking vice premier in 1995 under premier Li Peng. During this period, he served in a portfolio dealing with industry and reforming state-owned enterprises, and also oversaw the Three Gorges Dam.

The following year, Wu continued to lead studies on clonal heterogeneity and clonal evolution of CLL and was subsequently elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation. Wu later led a study analyzing genetic material in CLL and normal tissue of over 500 patients. Her research team identified numerous genetic abnormalities that had the ability to drive leukemia, including RPS15 and IKZF3 which had never before been linked to human cancer.In 2019, Wu continued her research on patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and led a research study which collaborated with scientists at the Broad Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the University of Washington. They found that genetic changes that occur very early in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia development directly influenced the growth pattern the CLL cells would ultimately take. As a result of her research, she was elected a Member of the National Academy of Medicine. Wu later led a study which uncovered why some patients become resistant to Venclexta, a Leukemia drug. Her research team used leukemia samples from before treatment with venetoclax and following their resistance. They then analyzed the tissue looking for genomic differences in the before and after relapse samples. The results of the analysis were lacking so they performed a large-scale loss-of-function screen to see the effect on other genes. Through this screening, they found that resistant cells make too much MCL1. Using a similar approach, Wu also studies how to implement personalized cancer vaccines by identifying neoantigen targets created by a patient's tumor. This immunotherapeutic effort is applicable to blood and solid tumor malignancies.\n\n\n== References ==\n"

            "early_life": "Wu's 1998 campaign for the Tainan County Council was supported by the Kuomintang. Throughout his tenure on the council, Wu maintained an interest in environmental causes affecting Southern Taiwan. In 2001, he backed Tainan County magistrate Mark Chen's decision to support Kueijen Township residents' protest of an Environmental Protection Administration plan to construct an industrial waste complex there. Wu was elected speaker of the county council in 2002. In 2003, Wu organized a demonstration at the Nanhua Reservoir, calling for the government to lift restrictions on development at the site while providing compensation for county residents. Shortly after Typhoon Morakot struck Taiwan in August 2009, Wu criticized the decision to build a water diversion tunnel through Mount Siandu. Completion of the tunnel was suspected to have contributed to a landslide that destroyed the village of Siaolin, Kaohsiung.Wu drew continuous attention for alleged ties to gangs. In March 2004, police alleged that Wu bet on the Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index, and won NT$50 million. He reportedly promised NT$18 million of the total to Chang Chao-lin of the Four Seas Gang if Chang helped Wu collect his winnings. Wu only received NT$6 million, and supposedly asked other gang members to pursue Chang. In March 2005, the Tainan District Prosecutors' Office sought Wu and Lee Chuan-fu for questioning. The pair were suspected of earning NT$1 billion in profit via Wu's Fu-hsin Company, which had begun dredging sand from the Tsengwen River in 2004. In the midst of the Tsengwen River case, Wu ran for reelection as Tainan County Council speaker and won in March 2006. The Tainan District Court heard charges against Wu, ruling in August 2008 that he was not guilty. Upon appeal, the Taiwan High Court ruled in May 2011 that Wu was guilty, extending his sentence to 42 months.In 2007, the Tainan District Prosecutors' Office began investigating Wu for gambling on Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) games. He contested the legislative elections held in January 2008, losing to Lee Chun-yee. In April of that year, the prison sentence in another gambling case against Wu relating to gambling houses in operation between 2004 and 2005 was commuted to a fine. Wu's CPBL gambling case continued with his indictment in August 2008 by prosecutors in Tainan. Further questioning of Wu undertaken in 2010 by Banqiao-based prosecutors established a link to the CPBL's 2009 gambling scandal. Wu was indicted by the Banqiao District Prosecutor's Office in February 2010. The New York Times reported in October 2016 that Wu would order players to be beaten if they refused to participate in match fixing. Following the Banqiao indictment, the Kuomintang expelled Wu. The party ordered affiliated Tainan city councillors to vote for themselves during the 2010 speakership election to keep Wu out of the office. He lost the office to Democratic Progressive Party candidate Lai Mei-hui by nine votes, 30\u201321. Ten Tainan City Council members were later expelled from the Kuomintang for not following the party's directive.Wu was removed from office in May 2011 after the Taiwan High Court found him guilty in the Tsengwen River case. In December 2011, Wu's appeal of the match fixing charges related to the 2007 probe led by the Tainan prosecutors was heard by the Taiwan High Court. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment, which he began serving in January 2012. The same court ruled on the 2009 charges in August 2014, sentencing Wu to 38 months in prison. Wu could not be located by law enforcement to serve this sentence, which was extended to 65 months on appeal due to Wu's attitude during the proceedings. In August 2017, Weng Ping-yao stated that Ma Ying-jeou offered payment for him to kill Alex Tsai in 2007. According to Weng, the deal fell through when Wu Chien-pao was named an additional target. In 2018, Wu was tracked to the Philippines. He was arrested by the Philippine Bureau of Immigration's Fugitive Search Unit on 16 January 2019. On 6 February 2019, Criminal Investigation Bureau officers from Taiwan's National Police Agency flew to Manila to extradite Wu. In April 2020, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court decision to convict Wu on the 2009 game fixing-related charges.\n"

Copies quickly sold out, and in early 2004 the study was published in book format, selling nearly 200,000 copies in under two months.

            "early_life": "Daniel N Wu was born in Berkeley, California, and raised in Orinda, California. His parents, Diana (n\u00e9e Liu), a college professor, and George Wu, a retired engineer, are natives of Shanghai, China. His father immigrated to the United States from China and met his mother in New York, where she was a student. After marrying, they settled in California. Wu has two older sisters, Greta and Gloria, and an older brother who died when he was two.Wu <<<developed an interest in martial arts when he saw Jet Li in The Shaolin Temple and Donnie Yen in Iron Monkey,>>> and consequently began studying wushu at age 11. <<<His childhood role model was Jackie Chan>>>, a man who now considers Wu \"like a son\". Wu attended the Head-Royce School in Oakland, California and later majored in architecture at the University of Oregon. While there, he founded the University of Oregon Wushu Club in 1994 and served as the team's first coach. During this time, Wu t<<<ook film classes and frequented local theaters>>>, and came to enjoy the works of filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa and Luc Besson, whom he describes as \"men of vision.\"Following graduation, Wu traveled in 1997 to Hong Kong to witness the handover of Hong Kong, with no intention of taking on a film career. At the suggestion by his sister, Wu began modeling. Four months later, film director Yonfan, after seeing Wu featured in a clothing ad, approached Wu about starring in an upcoming film.\nDespite his inability at the time to speak Cantonese or read Chinese, Wu successfully completed his first film, Yonfan's Bishonen in 1998. As of this day, when Wu receives a Cantonese script, his assistant reads the entire piece, while he makes notes on the pronunciation. The day after Bishonen wrapped, Wu was offered the leading role in Mabel Cheung's City of Glass (for which Wu was nominated as best new actor at the 18th Hong Kong Film Awards) and later, a supporting part in Young and Dangerous: The Prequel, from Andrew Lau's gangster film series. Around this time, Wu met Jackie Chan at a restaurant opening and was quickly signed to Chan's JC Group with agent Willie Chan.Wu's breakthrough performance came in 1999 with his role in Benny Chan's Gen-X Cops. He followed this success with roles in a variety of films including big-budget thriller Purple Storm, arthouse production Peony Pavilion and the successful Love Undercover. In 2001, Wu received criticism from the Hong Kong media for sexual scenes with Suki Kwan in Cop on a Mission, but Wu says that same criticism attracted the attention of directors and the film represented a turning point in the types of roles he chose in the future.Wu's first experience in film production came with his starring role in Julian Lee's 2003 film Night Corridor. Due to budgetary constraints, Wu participated in the search for funding for and distribution of, the film and recruited Jun Kung to create the soundtrack. Though Night Corridor dealt with \"risky\" themes, Wu felt he had less reliance on image than many of his pop-star actor peers, and he was nominated for best actor at Taiwan's 40th Golden Horse Film Awards for his effort. During 2003, Wu took part as producer and creative director on MTV's Whatever Things!, a Jackass-styled program aired in Asia, also featuring Sam Lee, Josie Ho, Terence Yin, and other celebrities. During 2003, Wu took part in a stage production of The Happy Prince at the Edward Lam Dance Theater as part of the Hong Kong Arts Festival, during which he recited a 16-minute monologue in Cantonese, learned entirely from pinyin. In 2005, Wu was nominated as best actor at the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards for his role in Derek Yee's One Nite in Mongkok, and as best supporting actor for New Police Story. At the 41st Golden Horse Film Awards, Wu won the award for best supporting actor for New Police Story. The win came as a surprise to him, because he \"didn't think that much\" of his performance in the film.\n\nIn 2005, Chinese media began to report that Wu had formed a boy band, Alive, with Terence Yin, Andrew Lin and Conroy Chan. Wu and his bandmates posted information, updates, personal thoughts (including slamming Hong Kong Disneyland, for which they were spokespersons), and the band's music, at their official website. In 2006, Wu made his writing and directorial debut with The Heavenly Kings, which chronicles Alive's formation and exploits. After the film's release, however, it was revealed that The Heavenly Kings was actually a mockumentary of the Hong Kong pop music industry, and Alive was constructed purely as a vehicle to make the film; the film's characters represented only 10\u201315% of their real-life counterparts and much of the footage blurred the line between fiction and reality. Wu admitted his own singing voice \"sucked really bad\", and the band had their voices digitally enhanced for its music, to prove that \"it's easy to fake it\". Despite some backlash from the media over being intentionally fed false information in the film about illegal downloads of the band's music, Wu won the best new director award at the 26th Hong Kong Film Awards, an achievement he called \"a group effort.\"In 2011, Wu starred alongside Kevin Spacey in director Dayyan Eng's bilingual film Inseparable. It premiered at the Busan International Film Festival and was released in cinemas in China and other territories worldwide, making it Wu's first English-language film performance.\nFrom 2015 to 2019, he starred as Sunny on the AMC action series Into the Badlands, for which he also served as executive producer.\nIn 2016, he portrayed via motion capture and voiced Gul'dan, the central antagonist of the action fantasy film Warcraft, based upon the Warcraft video game series  by Blizzard Entertainment. In 2018, he appeared in Tomb Raider, based upon the video game series of the same name, as Lara Croft's sidekick, Captain Lu Ren. In 2021, he appeared in Reminiscence, director Lisa Joy's feature film debut.\nWu maintains residences in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, and Oakland, California. He continues to actively train in wushu as well as other martial arts.On April 6, 2010, Wu married Lisa S. in South Africa. Their daughter, Raven, was born in May 2013.In 2018, Daniel Wu denied rumors of supporting Hong Kong independence and has explicitly stated his opposition for it.Both Wu and Lisa are godparents to Ase Wang's daughter.\n"

His mother had a career in advertising and now dedicates her time to an educational nonprofit.\nReturning to Taiwan at age 6 after his father completed his PhD, Wu attended elementary and middle school in Taipei.

Wu studied at high schools in Illinois and Michigan before enrolling in Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire.Wu obtained his bachelor's degree in economics from Yale College in 2003. While in college, he co-founded the Yale chapter of America Counts, a U.S. Department of Education initiative.\nWu was heavily influenced by his family and family friends' involvement in Taiwan's democratic movement. While in graduate school, his father Wu Nai-teh was an editor for dissident magazines, including Formosa Magazine and The Movement Magazine, advocating for democratic reforms while Taiwan was under martial law. After obtaining his PhD and returning to Taiwan, Wu Nai-teh was refused employment for two years at Academia Sinica, the premier research academy, on the grounds of harboring \"Taiwanese independence and subversive tendencies\" despite unanimous faculty approval.Civic engagement was a significant part of his upbringing. <<<At just nine years old, Wu began joining his family in protests and citizen movements>>>. <<<In middle school, Wu collected signatures for a nuclear power plant referendum>>>.\nAfter graduating from Yale College in 2003, Wu worked at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, primarily for the Special Situations Group, focusing on investment opportunities in Asia.

            "early_life": "Wu <<<obtained a bachelor's degree in law>>> from National Taiwan University, and <<<continued his legal studies at Harvard Law School while earning a master's in business administration>>> from Harvard University. Wu became a lawyer in New York before returning to Taiwan, where he taught at Soochow University and led the Taiwan Securities Company, a subsidiary of Taishin Financial Holdings, as chairman. Wu retained his business leadership positions while serving on the Legislative Yuan. Wu's elder brothers Thomas and Eugene are also businessmen. Eric Wu's sister Wu Ju-yueh is the eldest of his siblings. For a time, Eric Wu rented the residence of entrepreneur Chiang A-hsin, and established the Chin Kuang Fu Foundation in 1995 to maintain the property.\nWu was elected to the second Legislative Yuan from Hsinchu County as a member of the Kuomintang, serving from 1993 to 1996. He subsequently sat on the third convocation of the National Assembly, between 1996 and 2000. Wu was expelled from the Kuomintang in October 2001, after accepting a legislative nomination from the Taiwan Solidarity Union earlier that year. He won election as a party list member of the Legislative Yuan in December 2001. A month into his second term as legislator, the TSU nominated Wu to join the ROC-US Parliamentary Amity Association. He participated in overseas trips to Russia and Japan to further Taiwan's bilateral foreign relations. As a legislator with extensive business experience, Wu frequently commented on trade, economics, and industry. In June 2002, Wu explained that he and the TSU were not opposed to the three links between Taiwan and China. Rather, the party simply sought the continued implementation of Chen Shui-bian's \"no haste, be patient\" policy. In July 2003, he warned against Chinese investment in Taiwan, stating that Cross-Strait capital should be monitored to prevent politically motivated economic manipulation. As the 2003 SARS outbreak hit Taiwan, Wu and fellow TSU members Liao Pen-yen, Lo Chih-ming, Huang Chung-yuan, and Huang Cheng-che formed a working group to confront the issue. Fredrick Chien consulted Wu, among several others, when asked to form a committee to probe the 3-19 shooting incident, which injured Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu. In October 2004, Wu withdrew from consideration as a TSU candidate for the legislative elections planned in December, and consequently was not nominated for another term. Weeks before his second Legislative Yuan term ended, Wu considered attending the second inauguration of US President George W. Bush.\nIn August 2004, Thomas Wu was elected by the board of directors of Shinkong Synthetic Fibers Corporation to serve as company chairman. Their mother made it known that she preferred Eric take the position, and asked Thomas to step down. Eric and his mother contested Thomas's election, because members of the board were to be reselected prior to the vote that installed Thomas as chairman. As the chairmanship dispute unfolded, Eric and Thomas Wu were investigated by the Financial Supervisory Commission on suspicions of insider trading. In November 2004, the conflict was resolved. Thomas yielded the chairmanship of Shinkong Synthetic Fibers Corporation to Eric, and was named  to the same position at Taishin Financial Holdings. In turn, Eric ceded his proxy votes on the Taishin Financial board to Thomas. The FSC ruled in December 2004 that there were no financial gains, and therefore no insider trading, but that Taiwan Securities Company had not sought final approval to trade shares in Shinkong Synthetic Fibers. As a result, Taiwan Securities Company was fined NT$2.5 million. Additionally, Taishin Financial divested from Taishin Investment Trust, the latter of which was chaired by Eric.Eric Wu attempted to diversify his holdings in later years, exploring the potential acquisition of Taiwan Television Enterprise in December 2005, and bidding on Idee Department Store in November 2007. In September 2009, the Control Yuan voted to impeach prosecutor Lin Sheng-lin on charges of corruption. Lin had worked with Wu to establish a legal aid foundation, but was found to have extorted money, and divulged information pertinent to ongoing investigations.Under Wu's leadership, Shinkong Synthetic Fibers pursued a 4G telecommunications license in 2013. This was followed in 2014 by an increased investment in a joint venture with Invista, as well as another investment valued at NT$3 billion, in TacBright Optronics Corp, a subsidiary of Shinkong Synthetic Fibers. In 2017, Wu planned to increase the production of engineering plastics made by Shinkong Synthetic Fibers.\n\n\n== References ==\n"

Wu's father was an engineer at Ford Motor Company and his father lived in Detroit, Michigan.In his book Yellow and other writings, Wu recounts how his childhood experience of <<<being the only Asian American among his classmates and the schoolyard>>> taunting he endured as a result of his race alerted him to racial inequalities at an early age. He further describes how his attempts to assimilate and reject what was \"Asian\" only seemed to reinforce his marked difference to his peers.\nWhen Wu was a teenager, a Chinese American man, Vincent Chin, was killed by two white autoworkers in Highland Park, Michigan. The multiple criminal and civil cases that ensued throughout the 1980s have been recognized as birthing the Asian American victims and Asian American movement, and were marked as the 34th Michigan Legal Milestone in 2009. It was the Vincent Chin case that inspired Wu to pursue an active role in civil rights advocacy and the law.\nWu earned his bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1988 and his J.D. degree from the University of Michigan Law School in 1991. He completed courses at Harvard University Graduate School of Education.\nWu was formerly a law professor at Howard University, resuming a role he held from 1995 to 2004, and visiting professor at Johns Hopkins University, where he taught Asian Americans and the Law. He also was a CV Starr Foundation Visiting Professor at the School of Transnational Law at Peking University, in its English language JD program, in summer of 2009. He has previously taught at Stanford, Michigan, Columbia, Maryland, George Washington University, and Deep Springs College.\nFrom 2004 to 2008, Wu served as the ninth dean of Wayne State University Law School in Detroit, Michigan, succeeding the law school's first female dean, Joan Mahoney (1998\u20132003). Along with Harold Hongju Koh of Yale Law School and Jim Chen of the University of Louisville School of Law, Wu was one of only three Asian American law school deans in the United States. In April 2007, Wu announced he would resign as dean in May 2008, a year before his appointment was to end, citing his wife's health problems as the leading cause of his resignation. In 2008, he was one of two recipients of the Asian Pacific Fund Chang-Lin Tien Award, given for leadership in higher education. Named for the first Asian American to head a major research university, the award comes with a $10,000 honorarium. He also has received the Trailblazer Award from the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association.\nOn July 1, 2010, at age 42, Wu became the chancellor and dean of the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, until December 2015.\nWu succeeded Nell Newton, who departed in Summer 2009, and acting Chancellor and Dean Leo Martinez.

She went on to become the first female student to enroll in a graduate program in medical biophysics at the University of Toronto (1967-69). Robert A. Phillips supervised Wu's Master's in Science degree (MSc) research. Her thesis, titled Differentiation of Rosette-forming Cells from Clones of Hemopoietic Stem Cells, was supported by two consecutive graduate scholarships from NSERC and the Medical Research Council of Canada (CIHR). Wu's early interest in immunology was encouraged by Hardy Cinader.When she began her Master's degree (1967), she was the only graduate studies female student in the department.\nAfter completing her MSc, Wu did not proceed directly to pursue a doctorate. Instead, she worked as a biophysics technician at the Donner Radiation Labs in UC Berkeley (1969-71), and was a research associate at the National Cancer Institute, NIH, in Bethesda, Maryland, US (1975-76). \nIn 1980, she began her PhD studies at the University of Toronto in medical genetics under the supervision of Helios Murialdo, which resulted in four publications, including one in Cell. In 1984, she worked as a post-doctoral fellow at the Basel Institute for Immunology, after which she was recruited in 1986 to be an assistant professor in the newly formed Department of Immunology at the University of Toronto. In 1988, she moved to the Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics at the University of Toronto, staying until 1993, when she became a Senior Scientist at the Wellesley Hospital Research Institute.

Wu was admitted from high school to Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) with the highest entering grades in 1982. She received the first 3-year pre-medical education in this program at Peking University and then attended PUMC for clinical education. While at PUMC, she participated in laboratory research in immunology and became deeply fascinated by basic research. In 1987, Wu attended a scientific lecture on virus structure by Professor Michael Rossmann, a pioneer in X-ray crystallography who was visiting Beijing at the time. Instead of spending another two years to complete her M.D. degree, Wu resolved to come to the U.S. to pursue further scientific training. She entered the Ph.D. program in biochemistry at Purdue University in Indiana in 1988 under Professor Rossmann's supervision, graduating in 1992, and then moved to New York City to perform her postdoctoral work in Professor Wayne Hendrickson's laboratory at Columbia University.\nFollowing her postdoctoral work, Wu started an independent laboratory as assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry at Weill Cornell Medical College in 1997. She was promoted to associate professor in 2001 before becoming professor in 2003. In 2012, she was recruited to the Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine at Boston Children's Hospital as the Asa and Patricia Springer Professor of Structural Biology in the Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School.\n"

            ],
            "early_life": "Wu Hao was born in Nanking, China in 1932 and was educated at Suzhou Provincial Vocational High School.  <<<From a very early age Wu was interested in art and wanted to pursue a career in it>>>. <<<His grandfather was a Chinese brush painter>>> and his mother an embroiderer. Wu's father disapproved of his son's creative urges and wanted him to pursue a career that could more readily support him.  In 1949, <<<at the age of 17, the artist migrated solo to Taiwan on the ship>>> \u2018New Health\u2019 <<<in order to flee the Civil War that was taking place in China.  On this voyage were many intellectuals, artisans, students and wealthy citizens>>> who were also escaping from the Civil War, which saw the Communist Party take control of the Middle Kingdom and its national forces.  Between the late 1940s to the 1950s many conservative Chinese artists and radical modern painters moved to Taiwan. By doing so, they sought to promote freedom and protest against the communist regime, which was taking place in their home country.\nOn arrival in Taipei Wu Hao joined the Chinese Air Force as a junior officer. Wu was eventually promoted to a career officer and retired in 1971.  In 1967 the Department of National Defence awarded Wu with a medal of exemplary conduct.  Wu Hao practiced art throughout the entirety of his military career.\nIn 1950, as a young man in Taiwan, Wu attended an art school that was run by a group of renowned Chinese and Taiwanese artists such as Lee Chun-Sheng.  At this time, Wu could not afford to attend the classes. However, Wu convinced the administrator to give him a job as a part-time assistant, which enabled him to take part in many of the art classes taught by Lee.Lee Chun-Sheng, a well-known avant-garde artist and teacher, used his classrooms to promote and emphasise the importance of a variety of art movements in Taiwan.  Art movements regarding freedom, liberation and national identity were particularly important to the teacher. Colleagues and students of Lee's often described him as the \u201cpropagandist in the coffee room.\u201d   Having studied European painting in Japan prior to World War II, alongside traditional Chinese painting, Lee became an influential figure in the Taiwan art scene. Together with many others, Lee rebelled against traditionalists who criticised the modernist movement and aimed to reunite traditional Chinese and Taiwanese painting with Western art trends and modern abstractions.  Lee was an influential person throughout Wu's artistic career. This is particularly evident when viewing Wu's earlier and later westernised abstract oil paintings, inspired by the Western Surrealist art movement.  Whilst Wu Hao studied under the guidance of Lee Chun-Sheng, he began to enter his works into many art exhibitions, such as the Ministry of National Defence Annual Art Exhibition, and frequently won awards.During the 1950s, art materials were scarce and difficult to obtain in Taiwan. Wu, who at the time was living in poverty, resorted to using flower sacks as canvases to produce abstract oil paintings.  In the course of 1956, in conjunction with numerous other Chinese and Taiwanese artists, such as Chen Tao-Ming and Hsiao Ming-Hsien, Wu established the Tong Fan, a Taiwanese abstract painting group and art movement that explored Western styles of art, who have been credited for producing the first abstract paintings in the history of Chinese and Taiwanese art.  In 1957, a Tong Fan exhibition was held in Spain, drawing global attention to the movement.\nThroughout the 1960s, international communities had great influence on the art scene in Taiwan. Western art schools were institutionalised and taught a variety of styles including Abstractionalism, New-Objectitivism, Neoclassicism, Cubism, Surrealism, Expressionism, Structuralism, Fauvism, Symbolism, Pop Art, Minimalism, Optical Art, and so on.  This brought about a revival of the Taiwanese Nativist art movement, in which Wu was extremely influential. In 1964, Wu joined the Modern Print Society and began to produce woodblock prints. The artist temporarily abandoned oil painting, as he believed that woodblock printing was a more successful method for capturing the Orient's qualities, characteristics and identity.  The movement is thought to have emerged in 1949, and was typified by a deliberate rejection of Western art techniques that were initially introduced to Taiwan by the Japanese throughout their colonial rule. Furthermore, the movement aimed to portray indigenous Taiwanese cultural forms and their relationship to the Taiwanese social, economic, cultural and political identity.   Wu employed Nativism in his artwork to exert and explore national Taiwanese characteristics, particularly throughout the 1960s and 1970s when the movement was fruitfully revitalised. An example of this can be seen in Wu's 1967 woodblock print entitled Playing Music (annex 1).Wu's prints, for which he is best known, are often characterised by their bright and vibrant colouring and traditional Taiwanese folk like style. Often, Wu would print images depicting scenes of daily activities in the Taiwan countryside, a common theme for many Taiwanese artists of the time.  Wu's change to woodblock printing came at a time when Taiwan was becoming increasingly modernised and industrialised. Furthermore, a middle class was emerging with enough money to afford art, which changed the art scene in Taiwan.The artist returned to oil painting in 1978. During this time, Wu worked on developing both his technique and form. Wu revolutionised his work by creating oil paintings which appeared similar to that of a woodblock print.  Wu produced an extensive body of work thematically based on blooming flowers in his new style, often depicted alongside fruit. The artist used the symbol of a blooming flower (and occasionally ripe fruit) as a representation of contemporary Taiwan. Wu describes his blooming flowers as being cultivated and from soils of sorrows, reflecting Taiwan's difficult political and social past.  The prospering flowers in this body of work symbolises how strong Taiwan's identity, culture and heritage is in the contemporary era today. Flowers, (annex 2) painted in 1990, is an example of such a work.In 1987 Wu became chairman of the Chinese Modern Graphic Society and founded the Lee Chung-Sheng Modern Painting Education Foundation to commemorate the work of his influential past teacher.\n"

Wu was awarded a recurring role on the show, officially introducing her to the professional arena of television.\nJade Wu has since then, worked with actors such as; Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, George C. Wolf, Austin Pendleton, Jeanine Tesori, Jenifer Lewis, Ato Essandoh, Fred Weller, Geoff Arends, Tony Kushner, Ridley Scott, Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Tony Gilroy, Warren Leight, Paul McGuigan, Guerrmo Navarro, Vincenzo Natali, Peter Leto, Clark Johnson, Frank Prinzi, Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson.

            "early_life": "Xi Jinping was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953, the second son of Xi Zhongxun and his wife Qi Xin. <<<After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi's father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People's Congress>>>. Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An'an (\u5b89\u5b89; \u0100n'\u0101n), born in 1952. Xi's father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.Xi went to the Beijing No. 25 School, and then Beijing Bayi School, in the 1960s. He became friends with Liu He, who attended Beijing No. 101 School in the same district, who later became China's vice-premier and a close advisor to Xi after he became China's paramount leader. In 1963, when he was aged 10, his father was purged from the CCP and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan. In May 1966, the Cultural Revolution cut short Xi's secondary education when all secondary classes were halted for students to criticise and fight their teachers. Student militants ransacked the Xi family home and one of Xi's sisters, Xi Heping, committed suicide from the pressure.Later, his mother was forced to publicly denounce his father, as he was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. His father was later imprisoned in 1968 when Xi was aged 15. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement. He worked as the party secretary of Liangjiahe, where he lived in a cave house. According to people who knew him, this experience led him to feel affinity with the rural poor. After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches, but later returned to the village, spending a total of seven years there.The misfortunes and suffering of his family in his early years hardened Xi's view of politics. During an interview in 2000, he said, \"People who have little contact with power, who are far from it, always see these things as mysterious and novel. But what I see is not just the superficial things: the power, the flowers, the glory, the applause. I see the bullpens and how people can blow hot and cold. I understand politics on a deeper level.\" The \"bullpens\" (\u725b\u68da) was a reference to Red Guards' detention houses during the Cultural Revolution.After being rejected seven times, Xi joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1971 by befriending a local official. He reunited with his father in 1972, because of a family reunion ordered by premier Zhou Enlai. From 1973, he applied to join the CCP ten times and was finally accepted on his tenth attempt in 1974. From 1975 to 1979, Xi studied chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student in Beijing. The engineering majors there spent about 15 percent of their time studying Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Mao Zedong thought and 5 percent of their time doing farm work and \"learning from the People's Liberation Army\".\nFrom 1979 to 1982, Xi served as secretary for his father's former subordinate Geng Biao, the then vice premier and secretary-general of the CMC. In 1982, he was sent to Zhengding County in Hebei as deputy party secretary of Zhengding County. He was promoted in 1983 to secretary, becoming the top official of the county. Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his regional political career: Hebei (1982\u20131985), Fujian (1985\u20132002), Zhejiang (2002\u20132007), and Shanghai (2007). Xi held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, he was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP. However, of the 151 alternate members of the Central Committee elected at the 15th Party Congress, Xi received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing him last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to his status as a princeling.From 1998 to 2002, Xi studied Marxist theory and ideological education in Tsinghua University, graduating with a doctorate in law and ideology in 2002. In 1999, he was promoted to the office of Vice Governor of Fujian, and became governor a year later. In Fujian, Xi made efforts to attract investment from Taiwan and to strengthen the private sector of the provincial economy. In February 2000, he and then-provincial party secretary Chen Mingyi were called before the top members of PSC \u2013 general secretary Jiang Zemin, premier Zhu Rongji, vice president Hu Jintao and Discipline Inspection secretary Wei Jianxing \u2013 to explain aspects of the Yuanhua scandal.In 2002, Xi left Fujian and took up leading political positions in neighbouring Zhejiang. He eventually took over as provincial Party Committee secretary after several months as acting governor, occupying a top provincial office for the first time in his career. In 2002, he was elected a full member of the 16th Central Committee, marking his ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, Xi presided over reported growth rates averaging 14% per year. His career in Zhejiang was marked by a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials. This earned him a name in the national media and drew the attention of China's top leaders. Between 2004 and 2007, Li Qiang acted as Xi's chief of staff through his position as secretary-general of the Zhejiang Party Committee, where they both developed close ties.Following the dismissal of Shanghai Party secretary Chen Liangyu in September 2006 due to a social security fund scandal, Xi was transferred to Shanghai in March 2007, where he was the party secretary there for seven months. In Shanghai, Xi avoided controversy and was known for strictly observing party discipline. For example, Shanghai administrators attempted to earn favour with him by arranging a special train to shuttle him between Shanghai and Hangzhou for him to complete handing off his work to his successor as Zhejiang party secretary Zhao Hongzhu. However, Xi reportedly refused to take the train, citing a loosely enforced party regulation that stipulated that special trains can only be reserved for \"national leaders\". While in Shanghai, he worked on preserving unity of the local party organisation. He pledged there would be no 'purges' during his administration, despite the fact many local officials were thought to have been implicated in the Chen Liangyu corruption scandal. On most issues, Xi largely echoed the line of the central leadership.\nXi's first marriage was to Ke Lingling, the daughter of Ke Hua, China's ambassador to the United Kingdom in the early 1980s. They divorced within a few years. The two were said to fight \"almost every day\", and after the divorce Ke moved to England. In 1987, Xi married the prominent Chinese folk singer Peng Liyuan. Xi and Peng were introduced by friends as many Chinese couples were in the 1980s. Xi was reputedly academic during their courtship, inquiring about singing techniques. Peng Liyuan, a household name in China, was better known to the public than Xi until his political elevation. The couple frequently lived apart due largely to their separate professional lives. Peng has played a much more visible role as China's \"first lady\" compared to her predecessors; for example, Peng hosted U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama on her high-profile visit to China in March 2014.Xi and Peng have a daughter named Xi Mingze, who graduated from Harvard University in the spring of 2015. While at Harvard, she used a pseudonym and studied Psychology and English. Xi's family has a home in Jade Spring Hill, a garden and residential area in north-western Beijing run by the CMC.In June 2012, Bloomberg News reported that members of Xi's extended family have substantial business interests, although there was no evidence he had intervened to assist them. The Bloomberg website was blocked in mainland China in response to the article. Since Xi embarked on an anti-corruption campaign, The New York Times reported members of his family were selling their corporate and real estate investments beginning in 2012. Relatives of highly placed Chinese officials, including seven current and former senior leaders of the Politburo of the CCP, have been named in the Panama Papers, including Deng Jiagui, Xi's brother-in-law. Deng had two shell companies in the British Virgin Islands while Xi was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, but they were dormant by the time Xi became general secretary of the CCP in November 2012.\nIt is hard to gauge the opinion of the Chinese public on Xi, as no independent surveys exist in China and social media is heavily censored. However, he is believed to be widely popular in the country. According to a 2014 poll co-sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, Xi ranked 9 out of 10 in domestic approval ratings. A YouGov poll released in July 2019 found that about 22% of people in mainland China list Xi as the person they admire the most, a plurality, although this figure was less than 5% for residents of Hong Kong. In the spring of 2019, the Pew Research Center made a survey on confidence on Xi Jinping among six-country medians based on Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines and South Korea, which indicated that a median 29% have confidence in Xi Jinping to do the right thing regarding world affairs, meanwhile a median of 45% have no confidence; these numbers are slightly higher than those of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (23% confidence, 53% no confidence). A poll by Politico and Morning Consult in 2021 found that 5% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Xi, 38% unfavorable, 17% no opinion and 40%, a plurality, never hearing of him.In 2017, The Economist named him the most powerful person in the world. In 2018, Forbes ranked him as the most powerful and influential person in the world, replacing Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been ranked so for five consecutive years. Since 2013, Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the stated aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information, included Xi among the list of press freedom predators.Unlike previous Chinese leaders, Chinese state media has given a more encompassing view of Xi's private life, although still strictly controlled. According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi would swim one kilometer and walk every day as long as there was time, and is interested in foreign writers, especially Russian. He is known to love films and TV shows such as Saving Private Ryan, The Departed, The Godfather and Game of Thrones, also praising the independent film-maker Jia Zhangke. The Chinese state media has also cast him as a fatherly figure and a man of the people, determined to stand up for Chinese interests.\n"

She then <<<entered the Film Studies Program at the Communication University of China>>>, where she completed her Master's thesis: \"A Study on Female Figures in Science Fiction Films\". Recently, she <<<obtained a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and World Literature>>> at Peking University, with \"Chinese Science Fiction and Its Cultural Politics Since 1990\" as the topic of her dissertation. She now teaches at School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University.During her collegiate life she began to write science fiction works and took part in student clubs for science fiction and fantasy fans. Her short stories have attracted critical acclaim from the outset, beginning with her early Chinese Galaxy Award recipient \"Guan Yaojing de Pingzi\" \u5173\u5996\u7cbe\u7684\u74f6\u5b50 (April 2004 Science Fiction World trans Linda Rui Feng as \"The Demon-Enslaving Flask\" November 2012 Renditions). A work of Fabulation, in which the Scientist James Clerk Maxwell (1831\u20131879) is offered a Faustian challenge by a literal demon, its selection was attended by a spat among critics as to whether it could be called sf at all. The story is mired so deeply in anecdotes from the history of science, and literal interpretations of famous thought experiments, that it requires copious footnotes to explain its own jokes (infodump). This, however, seems very much in keeping with the classical, didactic tradition in Chinese sf, creating a story whose fantasy elements are mere vectors to convey information about the life and work of icon figures such as Archimedes, Albert Einstein, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and Maxwell himself.Later work mirrored her personal academic journey from hard science into the creative arts. Her first longer work was  \"Jiuzhou Nil\u00fc\" \u4e5d\u5dde\u2022\u9006\u65c5 \"On the Road: Odyssey of China Fantasy\" (coll of linked stories 2009), part of the Jiuzhou shared-universe fantasy series. \"Bai Gui Ye Xing Jie\" \u767e\u9b3c\u591c\u884c\u8857 (August 2010  Science Fiction World trans Ken Liu as \"A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight\" February 2012 Clarkesworld) is far subtler and more mature, a child's eye view of life inside what first appears to be a haunted Keep redolent of Chinese ghost stories, but is gradually revealed as a run-down Far Future theme park populated with Cyborg simulacra. It was nominated for the Short Form Award of 2013 Science Fiction & Fantasy Translation Awards announced at Liburnicon 2013, held in Opatija, Croatia, over August 23\u201325, 2013, and received honorable mention at the ceremony.On June 4, 2015 (online on the previous date) Xia Jia's short story \"Let's have a talk\" (\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u8bf4\u8bf4\u8bdd) was published on Nature, 522, 122.

Despite being chosen partly because of his facial resemblance to a young Jiang, Xia's spirited and moving performance as a renegade youth conquered audiences. He was rocketed to international stardom after he won the Best Actor award from the Venice Film Festival (the youngest actor to win that award in the history of the festival), Singapore International Film Festival and Golden Horse Awards.Xia wanted to study drama after his first film, he was accepted into the Central Academy of Drama. After completing his studies there, Xia remained an active force in Chinese cinema as well as television, appearing in many films and television series. Xia's second film Shadow Magic demonstrated his talent as an actor and earned him a nomination for Best Actor at the Tokyo International Film Festival. His earlier film credits also includes  Roots and Branches (2001) and Where Have All the Flowers Gone (2002). Xia's subsequent films, The Law of Romance (2003) won him a Golden Rooster Award for Best Actor and Waiting Alone (2005) earned him Best Actor at the Beijing College Student Film Festival. With five best actor titles at international film festivals, Xia Yu has been named one of the top 4 hottest young actors in China.Like many of today\u2032s actors in China, Xia Yu also has an extensive TV career, appearing on such shows as Records of Kangxi's Travel Incognito, Classical Romance and Sky Lovers. Most of Xia\u2032s TV roles have been secondary ones until he was cast to star in The Ugliest In the World, where he played Liu Baoshan, a genius of the Qing Dynasty who gave up the opportunity to become an official in order to become a clown.Aside from local productions, Xia has also starred in two Hollywood films; China: The Panda Adventure (2001) and The Painted Veil (2006). Xia also starred alongside Shilpa Shetty in the Indian-Chinese film The Desire (2010). In 2016, he took on the role of Wong Jack-man in the Bruce Lee biopic Birth of the Dragon, produced by American filmmaker George Nolfi.In 2017, Xia reunited with Waiting Alone director Dayyan Eng in fantasy comedy film Wished, which became one of the highest-grossing domestic comedy titles for the summer season.In 2019, it was announced that Xia will play Shen Gongbao in the upcoming fantasy film series Fengshen Trilogy directed by Wuershan. The film is based on the novel Investiture of the Gods.\nXia Yu married actress Yuan Quan in 2009, a decade after their first date as students in Central Academy of Drama. They have appeared in 4 films together: The Law of Romance (2003), Waiting Alone (2004), Shanghai Rumba (2006) and Breakup Buddies (2014). Their daughter was born on 31 March  2010.Xia is an avid skateboarder. He fell in love with skateboarding after watching it in Gleaming the Cube, a popular movie when he was young.

            "early_life": "Xia received, in 1982, from Nanjing University <<<a bachelor's degree in astronomy>>> and in 1988, <<<a PhD in mathematics>>> from Northwestern University with thesis advisor Donald G. Saari, for his thesis, The Existence of the Non-Collision Singularities. From 1988 to 1990, Xia was an assistant professor at Harvard University and from 1990 to 1994, an associate professor at Georgia Institute of Technology (and Institute Fellow). In 1994, he became a full professor at Northwestern University and since 2000, he has been the Arthur and Gladys Pancoe Professor of Mathematics.His research deals with celestial mechanics, dynamical systems, Hamiltonian dynamics, and ergodic theory. In his dissertation, he solved the Painlev\u00e9 conjecture, a long-standing problem posed in 1895 by Paul Painlev\u00e9. The problem concerns the existence of singularities of non-collision character in the \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  -body problem in three-dimensional space; Xia proved the existence for \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        \u2265\n        5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N\\geq 5}\n  . For the existence proof, he constructed an example of five masses, of which four are separated into two pairs which revolve around each other in eccentric elliptical orbits about the z-axis of symmetry, and a fifth mass moves along the z-axis. For selected initial conditions, the fifth mass can be accelerated to an infinite velocity in a finite time interval (without any collision between the bodies involved in the example). The case \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        =\n        4\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N=4}\n   was open until 2014, when it was solved by Jinxin Xue. For \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        =\n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N=3}\n  , Painlev\u00e9 had proven that the singularities (points of the orbit in which accelerations become infinite in a finite time interval) must be of the collision type. However, Painlev\u00e9's proof did not extend to the case \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        >\n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N>3}\n  .\nIn 1993, Xia was the inaugural winner of the Blumenthal Award of the American Mathematical Society. From 1989 to 1991, he was a Sloan Fellow. From 1993 to 1998, he received the National Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation. In 1995, he received the Monroe H. Martin Prize in Applied Mathematics from the University of Maryland. In 1998, he was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin.\n"

Xiao's original interest was the Yuan dynasty, but from the mid-1980s he turned his attention to the history of the late Qing and early Republican periods.In his early academic career, Xiao studied the thought of Yan Fu, an influential Chinese scholar and Westerniser of this era, questioning the negative historical reputation that had become attached to Yan because of his later support for conservative projects such as Yuan Shikai's attempted monarchist restoration. Xiao came to the conclusion that Yan was a consistent incremental reformist who had struck a middle course between outright reaction and the wholesale abandonment of China's national identity. Building on his work on Yan, Xiao went on to make a broader reevaluation of the fall of the Qing dynasty, arguing that the Hundred Days' Reform of 1898 failed primarily not because of the conservatism of Cixi but because of the radicalism of Kang Youwei and his allies.\n"

            "early_life": "Born in Chongqing in 1955, Xu grew up in Beijing. <<<His father was the head of the history department>>> at Peking University. In 1975, near the end of the Cultural Revolution, he was relocated to the countryside for two years as part of Mao Zedong's \"re-education\" policy. Returning to Beijing in 1977, he <<<enrolled at the Central Academy of Fine Arts>>> (CAFA) in Beijing, where he joined the printmaking department and also worked during a short period of time as a teacher, receiving his master's degree in Fine Art in 1987. After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, his recent work came under scrutiny from the government and received harsh criticism for what was perceived as a critique of the Chinese government. Due to the political pressure and artistic restrictions of the post-Tiananmen period in China, Xu Bing, like many of his contemporaries, moved to the United States in 1990 where he was invited by the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. He then resided to the United States until his appointment as vice-president of the Beijing CAFA in 2008.\nIn 1990\u201391, Xu had his first exhibition in the United States at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison's Elvehjem Museum of Art (now Chazen Museum of Art) including his installations A Book from the Sky and Ghosts Pounding the Wall. In Book from the Sky, the artist invented 4,000 characters and hand-carved them into wood blocks, then used them as movable type to print volumes and scrolls, which are displayed laid out on the floor and hung from the ceiling. The vast planes of text seem to convey ancient wisdom, but are in fact unintelligible. The Glassy Surface of a Lake, a site-specific installation for the Elvehjem, was on view in 2004\u201305. In this work, a net of cast aluminum letters forming a passage from Henry David Thoreau's Walden stretches across the museum's atrium and pours down into an illegible pile of letters on the floor below.\nWorking in a wide range of media, Xu creates installations that question the idea of communicating meaning through language, demonstrating how both meanings and written words can be easily manipulated. He received a MacArthur Foundation grant in July 1999, presented to him for \"originality, creativity, self-direction, and capacity to contribute importantly to society, particularly in printmaking and calligraphy.\"\nIn 2003 he exhibited at the then new Chinese Arts centre in Manchester, and in 2004 he won the inaugural \"Artes Mundi\" prize in Wales for Where does the dust collect itself?, an installation using dust he collected in New York City on the day after the destruction of the World Trade Center. He won also a half year of free work and study at the American Academy in Berlin 2004.Xu Bing was appointed the new vice president of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, March 2008.\n"

            "early_life": "On April 16, 1974, Xu was born in Beijing, China. \nXu <<<graduated from Beijing Film Academy>>> in 1997. She <<<later returned as a teacher at the Performing Department>>>.Xu grew up with her parents and her younger brother. Xu Jinglei's father Xu Zijian and his mother Yu Shurong are both middle-class workers. Her Father, Xu Zijian is the director of the Great Wall Neon Factory in Beijing.\nXu was recommended to a middle school in Beijing's Chaoyang District because of her extraordinary calligraphy skills. However, she didn't like calligraphy, but was forced by her father to study in the calligraphy class in Beijing Children's Palace to practice calligraphy every day and recite poems of Tang poetry under the strict education of her father. As a child, Xu was not confident at all, and she never thought of being an actress or director.Later, Xu Jinglei fell in love with painting. When she was 17, she spent a long time commuting to learn painting and determined to study make-up as a major in the Stage Art department of The Central Academy of Drama. However, she was not admitted by The Central Academy of Drama, but was instead admitted to the acting department of Beijing Film Academy, starting her career of acting and directing later.\nIn 1994, she first entered the film industry by starring in the TV series \"My Deskmate\". Xu Jinglei rose to fame in China with the television series A Sentimental Story (1997), where she played a policewoman who falls for a gangster. Thereafter, she starred in romance film Spicy Love Soup (1997), where she won the Society Award at the Golden Phoenix Awards for her performance. In 1998, she was elected the third most popular contemporary actress among college students and the top 10 stunners of the New Weekly. In the same year, she took part in the TV drama \"Love to the End\". Xu solidified her success in 2002 with the films Spring Subway and I Love You, both popular hits in China and particularly with younger audiences.\nIn 1998, Xu and actor Li Yapeng paired up in Cherish Our Love Forever, a story based on the life and love between a group of young college students. The television series struck a chord with young audiences and became a massive hit in China, where Xu and Li were hailed as the \"Nation's Couple\". The two would later pair up again for the film sequel Eternal Moment (2011), set ten years after the drama.Xu solidified her success in 2002 with the films Spring Subway and I Love You, both popular hits in China and particularly with younger audiences. Along with Zhang Ziyi, Zhou Xun and Zhao Wei, Xu was hailed as one of the Four Dan Actresses in China. Xu won the Huabiao Award for Outstanding New Actress for her performance in I Love You and the Hundred Flowers Award for Best Actress for Spring Subway. The same year, she won the Golden Rooster Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in Far from Home.In June 2005, Time named Xu Jinglei as the only Chinese director and actor in an article entitled \"China's New Revolution\", and called her \"a representative revolutionary figure in the Chinese film industry\".In 2006, Xu starred alongside Takeshi Kaneshiro, Tony Leung and Shu Qi in the crime drama Confession of Pain. She received her first acting award in Hong Kong; the year's Most Attractive Actress at the Hong Kong Society of Cinematographers (HKSC) Awards. Xu was then cast as the female lead in the war epic, The Warlords (2007) by Peter Chan.After an extended hiatus from acting, Xu made a comeback in the science fiction thriller Battle of Memories (2017).\nXu made her directorial debut with the film My Father and I (2003), where she also starred as the lead actress. The film, which tackled the delicate relationship between a Chinese father and his daughter, received widespread critical acclaim and won her a Golden Rooster for Best Directing Debut. Her second directorial work, Letter from an Unknown Woman (2004) was a romantic story based on the classic novel of Stefan Zweig, and won her the Silver Shell for Best Director at the San Sebastian International Film Festival in Spain.After two successful art-house films, Xu had a shot in innovative film making in Dreams Come True (2006),  an experimental film shot in one setting. However unlike her previous two films, Dreams Come True was panned by critics.Xu became the first female director in China whose films gross more than 100 million yuan, for her 2010 film Go Lala Go!. The film, adapted from Li Ke's bestseller of the same name which is about a young woman's growth in society, is Xu's first attempt at commercial production. Go Lala Go! shows the life of middle-class, revealing the accelerated pace of the society as well as the degradation of the social welfare system as a consequence of the rise of neoliberal mindset. The ideology difference between Go Lala Go! and My Father and I indicates a transition of China's old society to the new society, articulating the social reconstruction of China.In 2014,  Xu Jinglei, as the only female director, ranked fifth on the Chinese directors value list, which selected from mainland directors who have independently directed five or more films in theaters in the past two decades. Xu appears as  \"the first female director who has directed six films independently and has earned more than 100 million yuan at the domestic box office and won the international Film Festival awards\" on the list. Some industry insiders said that although the persistent exploration of literary avant-garde themes may affect her box office performance, the 36.25 percent return rate confirms the significant effect of \"director Xu Jinglei\" in the audiences' mind.Xu continued to direct romantic features Dear Enemy (2011) and Somewhere Only We Know (2015), which were moderately successful at the box office.Deviating from her former productions which mainly focuses on romance and family, Xu returned with action cop thriller The Missing in 2017. She also announced that she would be producing an alien-themed online comedy series based on the popular online novel \"My 200-Million-Year-Old Classmate\". This is China's first science fiction school-themed online drama, adapted from the novel of the same name, talking about a story of an alien named Abdouri takes over a high school girl, Xuan Mo's body. First time acting as the producer of a web series, Xu indicates that she didn't do it on a whim, but instead hopes to make a movie-like web series. She chose to work on this series because she saw the uniqueness of the characters and the setting of the story and want to create a milestone for Chinese television industry. For best results, Xu called in her own film crew to help. In addition, in order to present the perfect science fiction special effects in this school youth drama with science fiction elements, Xu Jinglei also invited Nick Hsieh, an international special effects supervisor who has participated in the production of blockbusters such as Pacific Rim and Star Wars, as the special effects director.\n"

When you reach that age, you hide well in reality. This work calmly reveals that hidden thing.\nSoo-jung is the daughter of Jeong Ae-ran who was a popular actress of 50s, 60s and 70s.
