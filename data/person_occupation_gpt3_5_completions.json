The team was promoted to the Premier League in his first season with the club, which then meant that Paatelainen became the first Finnish footballer to play in the Premier League (as the old First Division had been rebranded in 1992). He played a crucial part in the promotion triumph, putting Bolton 3\u20132 ahead in their playoff final clash with Reading in extra time on their way to a 4\u20133 victory which ended a 15-year exile from the top flight.\nPaatelainen also played in the 1995 League Cup Final, in which Wanderers were beaten 2\u20131 by Liverpool.

He is fondly remembered by Hibernian supporters for his hat-trick in a 6\u20132 victory over Edinburgh derby rivals Heart of Midlothian on 22 October 2000. Paatelainien's appearance for Hibs in their 2001 Scottish Cup Final defeat by Celtic meant that he became the first player to play in the Scottish Cup final with three clubs. Despite this, Paatelainien never collected a winners medal in the competition. Paatelainen left Hibs in 2001 to sign for French club Strasbourg. He then returned to Hibs for one season, where he combined his playing duties with coaching the youths.In 2003, he transferred to St Johnstone, when Hibs no longer wished to extend his contract, also acting as an assistant manager.

        "early_life": "Rua started his career at Chute Boxe Academy in Curitiba, Brazil, a Muay Thai training group which has produced champions like Wanderlei Silva. Ninja's first foray into MMA was with Brazilian-based Meca World Vale Tudo, where he amassed an impressive 5\u20130\u20131 record before signing with Pride Fighting Championships.\nNinja made his PRIDE debut against Daijiro Matsui in September 2001, which he won via referee stoppage after repeated kicks and stomps. After losing a close decision to Dan Henderson, Rua went on to defeat Alex Andrade, and Alexander Otsuka. Rua was scheduled to fight for the Meca Middleweight (205 lb) title vs Jorge Navalhada, but was injured, and could not fight for the title. After returning from injury, he defeated Mario Sperry, and this fueled beginning of the long lasting rivalry between Chute Boxe and Brazilian Top Team. Rua lost to Ricardo Arona in a close battle of attrition, and Sergei Kharitonov in the Pride Total Elimination 2004, where he fought as a heavyweight, suffering a brutal knockout loss.\nAt Pride 29, Rua faced Quinton Jackson. Rua lost the fight by split decision which was controversial. Jackson was noticeably confused with the result and attempted to offer the winner's trophy to Rua following the decision. Commentators such as Mauro Ranallo and Bas Rutten, who were present at the bout, also have stated that they thought Rua had won the fight.\nRua fought three more times in Pride, defeating newcomer Murad Chunkaiev before dropping a lacklustre decision against top ranked Paulo Filho. Nevertheless, Rua was selected as part of the Pride welterweight (185 pound) Grand Prix. In the opening bracket, however, he was knocked out by Denis Kang. Rua then left Pride for a tenure with British MMA promotion Cage Rage in order to strengthen the tie between the two promotions. His first bout, against English UFC veteran Mark Weir, resulted in a victory by submission after a rough and tumble affair. He also defeated Alex Reid via doctor stoppage before the newly created EliteXC organization purchased Cage Rage, therefore he fought for the vacant Elite XC middleweight at Strikeforce: Shamrock vs. Baroni against Greg Jackson trained Joey Villasenor and recorded a second-round TKO, stopping Villasenor with strikes. After three months as the champion, his first title defense came to ICON sport middleweight champion Robbie Lawler. Despite narrowly winning the first two rounds, an exhausted Ninja was defeated via a third-round TKO at EliteXC: Uprising. He rebounded with a victory over Muay Thai fighter and Cage Rage contender Xavier Foupa-Pokam at Cage Rage 24: Feel the pain.\nOn December 18, 2007, Sherdog.com reported that both Rua and his brother Mauricio had left the Chute Boxe camp with plans to open up their own facility in Massachusetts. The Ruas' new camp was named Universidade da luta, which translates to \"University of Fighting\", and instead was opened in the Ruas' hometown of Curitiba, Brazil.\nRua was initially scheduled to fight Phil Baroni on the May 31, 2008, EliteXC card, however, he suffered a minor foot injury which led him to fight on the June 14 card instead, where he recorded a dominant KO victory over undefeated Tony Bonello. On October 4, 2008, Rua was defeated by Benji Radach on a live CBS broadcast. Radach finished the fight with punches to Rua's head after a failed flying knee sent him sprawling on his back.\nRua made his Dream debut at Dream 8 against Riki Fukuda on April 5, 2009.

The middleweight bout between Falaniko Vitale and Rua, previously announced for Shine Fights Worlds Collide: Mayorga vs. Thomas, was scrapped due to an injury sustained by Vitale.\nRua was planning to participate in Dream 14, though that event being rescheduled led to other plans.Rua beat Jeremy May on July 18, 2010, at Impact Fighting Championships by submission via guillotine choke.\nRua lost to Cesar Gracie product Roy Boughton via unanimous decision on October 23, 2010 (2010-10-23). Boughton missed weight by 5.5 lbs.\n\"Ninja\" fought Tom Watson for the BAMMA Middleweight Title on May 21, 2011. The fight proved to be a one sided affair, with Rua being rocked several times throughout the fight, as well as being visibly hurt with leg kicks. The end came at 2:06 of the third round after Watson stunned Rua with a head kick and followed up with strikes until the referee stepped in to save the unconscious Rua.After Rua lost against Tom Watson, he said he would not continue fighting and would retire.\nRua is now set to come out of retirement to fight a rematch against Pride FC vet and former World Extreme Cage Fighting middleweight champion  Paulo Filho.\nThe two originally met at Pride Bushido 10 where Paulo Filho won by unanimous decision after three rounds.\nRua once again lost to Filho by yet another controversial referee stoppage by Mario Yamasaki. Filho landed a strong combination which rocked Rua, forcing him to shoot for a single leg take down. Yamasaki saw this as a reason to stop the fight, and stepped in to save Rua.\nRua and longtime girlfriend Ana married on October 8, 2004, in Curitiba, Brazil.

She said those influences were especially important to her as a child. During an interview with Faiza Elmasry in 2010, Fuchs said, \"I think like many of the children in our world, I got interested in science just from having a butterfly net and from having a few strainers and some boots and going down to the streams and creeks and being out in the fields.\" Even her mother, who was a homemaker, inspired her to pursue her interest in science at a time when not many women went into scientific fields. \"She was a housewife but she took pride in everything that she did. She encouraged my sister and me in all different ways. My mom always said, 'You're a good cook, you'll make a fine scientist,' when I told her that I like science. So I think those kinds of little things maybe are more important that any of the bigger things.\"Fuchs earned a B.S. in chemistry in 1972 from the University of Illinois, graduating with highest distinction in the Chemical Sciences. She began as one of only three women in an undergraduate physics class of 200. Fuchs was politically active during college, protesting the Vietnam War and applying to the Peace Corps with the intention of being posted in Chile. However, when she was instead assigned to Uganda, then under the dictatorship of Idi Amin, she elected to go directly to graduate school.When applying to graduate school, Fuchs refused to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). During an interview in 2009, Fuchs stated, \u201c\u2026I felt that the Graduate Record Examination wasn\u2019t testing my real knowledge, but rather how I could perform in a written exam.\u201d Instead, she submitted a three-page explanation with her applications explaining why she would not be taking the GRE. Though she was accepted everywhere she applied, she admits that her defiant statement would not likely be looked upon the same way today. \u201cI don\u2019t think professors are as open-minded toward rebellious students as they were during the Vietnam War era.\u201d Fuchs earned her Ph.D. in biochemical sciences from Princeton University in 1977. Her doctoral dissertation was titled \"The biosynthesis and assembly of the peptidoglycan sacculus of Bacillus Megatorium.\" Fuchs began her work on skin biology during her postdoctoral work with Howard Green at MIT. In Green's lab she studied the mechanisms underlying growth and differentiation in epidermal keratinocytes.\nFuchs accepted a faculty position at the University of Chicago in 1980 and was the first woman in the biochemistry department. Her first publications there reported the first cloning and sequencing of keratin cDNAs that characterized the two types of keratins. At the University of Chicago she was mentored and befriended by Janet Rowley and Susan Lindquist; they eventually all joined the reorganized Department of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, in which Fuchs was ultimately appointed the Amgen Professor of Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology. In 2002, Fuchs accepted a position at Rockefeller University, where she is currently the Rebecca C. Lancefield Professor of Mammalian Cell Biology and Development and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Fuchs is known for her study of skin, identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying skin disease, developing the field of skin stem cells, and pioneering reverse genetics. Her research group uses laboratory mice and mammalian epithelial stem cell culture as model systems. Recently, she has been devoting her research to studies on the role stem cells play in the regeneration of tissue, as well as the competing demands of proliferation and differentiation in maintaining enough stem cells.Fuchs currently sits on the board of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation.

[The] sort of place where the people are outnumbered by sheep. You know the type: loads of fields, two pubs, a hairdresser and about a mile away from the local shop.\"Mead started playing football when she was six years old. Her mother wanted her to run off her boundless energy and took her to a Saturday morning football session on a village field in Hinderwell, which was run by a volunteer coach. He said to her and her mother, \"It's fine that you're coming down to get involved but you will be the only girl here. They are quite rough so will she be ok?\" Her mother replied, \"She'll be fine.\" But when her mother came back an hour later, he said Mead was rougher than most of the boys. She played with the local boys on that bobbly community field as much as possible, regardless of which animals were on it or how long the grass was.Mead took part in many sports, including cross-country running, netball, cricket, and field hockey, but \"football always hit [her] different.\" She said: \"I loved what I was doing on the pitch and had no other worry in the world \u2014 nothing else mattered except me kicking that football. Football is my first love; my one true love. It still breaks my heart sometimes, but that's part and parcel of the game.

That\u2019s never changed, from the six-year-old kid to the 27-year-old who's running around now.\" One day, Mead's local senior cricket team was one short.

The local newspaper called it 'The Mead Show'.:\u200aCh. 2\u200aMead went to Oakridge Community Primary School in Hinderwell. There was no girls' football team at school, so she played for the boys' team. She was the only girl. However, the more she played, the more other girls wanted to join in. She was captain of the primary school team, and that made the other girls feel more comfortable, seeing she had been accepted and made captain.

Her teammates used to tell the other team to laugh ahead of kick-off because they knew that as soon as the game started, she would be running rings around them. She minded neither because her dad told her, \"While some people will always have opinions, and you would hear a few things, you don't need to say anything, and neither do I\u2013your football will do the talking.\" After most games, she earned a lot of respect from teams and their parents for getting stuck in and playing well.When Mead was just 13 or 14 at Middlesbrough academy, she scored a hat-trick against Sunderland, one of the best teams in England at the time, in six or seven minutes.

Following the release of the group's Christmas album, the group's contract was terminated by their record company, which shocked G-Dragon. Although he vowed to his mother that he \"wouldn't [try to become a singer] again,\" he was scouted by SM Entertainment on a ski trip with his family. He was a trainee under the record label SM Entertainment  for five years (from 8\u201313 years old), specializing in dance before he left.During his third grade year, a friend introduced G-Dragon to the American rap group Wu-Tang Clan. Having been influenced by their music, he developed interest in rapping and began taking classes. After attending a summer school hosted by the South Korean hiphop group People Crew which he joined after begging his mom, he was introduced to Lee Hee sung, who was member of another South Korean hip hop group X-teen, who tried to make G-dragon into Korea's Bow Wow. Under People Crew's tutelage, he participated in the release of the Korean hip-hop album Korean hiphop Flex(\ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d \ud799\ud569\ud50c\ub809\uc2a4 2001) in 2001, becoming the youngest Korean rapper at 13 years old. Although he wrote his own lyrics, he admitted that his English was weak and the story behind the lyrics was just another typical \"I'm young, but I'm the best\" story. Additionally, he and future fellow BigBang member Choi Seung-hyun were \"neighborhood friend[s] from middle school\" and would often dance and rap together before G-Dragon moved away. Catching the interest of Sean of the hip-hop duo Jinusean from YG Entertainment, he recommended G-Dragon to Sean's record label's CEO Yang Hyun Suk. After signing a contract with the record label, G-Dragon spent the first year cleaning the studio for the other artists in the record label and fetching water bottles during dance practice.\n\nHe chose the stage name G-Dragon (\"Ji\" is pronounced like \"G\", and Yong is Korean for \"dragon\"). He featured on other artists' albums and even released several singles with Dong under the name \"GDYB.\" After YG Entertainment scrapped the plan and opted for a boy band instead, G-Dragon contacted Choi, who auditioned in. G-Dragon, Dong (who chose the stage name Taeyang), and Choi (who chose the stage name T.O.P), were paired with three other members (Jang Hyun-seung, Daesung, and Seungri).\nThe formation of the group was documented on television, but prior to their official debut, Jang was dropped. The now-quintet's debut was a moderate success, with their first album selling over 100,000 copies, and included G-Dragon's first solo recording, a cover of the American alternative rock group Maroon 5's single \"This Love\". The release of the EP Always in 2007 was a musical departure from their previous materials and saw G-Dragon's increased involvement in its production. Several songs were composed by him, including the lead-single \"Lies\", which became the group's first number one hit. Their following EPs followed its predecessor's footsteps: Hot Issue yielded \"Last Farewell\" while Stand Up spawned \"Day by Day\"; both singles, composed by him, were chart-toppers. Having produced the majority of BigBang's materials, G-Dragon became involved with the production of Taeyang's debut extended play Hot (2008), after which he subsequently recorded a \"Part Two\" to the EP's lead single \"Only Look at Me\".\nG-Dragon enrolled at Kyung Hee University in 2008 to study post-modern music.

Rea was \"a major European star by the time he finally cracked the UK Top 10\" with his single \"The Road to Hell (Part 2)\" and has also dealt with several waves of illness during his long career which have often informed his songs. The album, The Road to Hell (1989), topped the album chart, as did its successor, Auberge (1991).

A decade later, \"Working On It\" topped the Mainstream Rock chart. He has sold more than 40 million records worldwide.",
        "early_life": "Christopher Rea was born on 4 March 1951 in Middlesbrough in the North Riding of Yorkshire to an Italian father, Camillo Rea (died December 2010) originating from Arpino in the Province of Frosinone, and an Irish mother, Winifred K. Slee (died September 1983), as one of seven children. His family were of the Roman Catholic faith. The name Rea was well known locally thanks to his father's ice cream factory and caf\u00e9 chain. When he was twelve, he worked clearing tables in the coffee bar and making ice cream in the factory. He wanted to improve the business, but his ideas got no support from his father. After leaving, he was replaced by one of his brothers. At that time he wanted to be a journalist and attended St Mary's College, Middlesbrough.Rea bought his first guitar in his early twenties, a 1961 Hofner V3 and 25-watt Laney amplifier He played primarily \"bottleneck\" guitar, also known as slide guitar. Rea's playing style was inspired by Charlie Patton whom he had heard on the radio. He had initially thought Patton's playing sounded like a violin. Rea was also influenced by Blind Willie Johnson and Sister Rosetta Tharpe as well as by the playing of Ry Cooder and Joe Walsh. He was also listening to Delta blues musicians like Sonny Boy Williamson II and Muddy Waters, gospel blues, and opera to light orchestral classics to develop his style. He recalls that \"for many people from working-class backgrounds, rock wasn't a chosen thing, it was the only thing, the only avenue of creativity available for them\", and that \"when I was young I wanted most of all to be a writer of films and film music. But Middlesbrough in 1968 wasn't the place to be if you wanted to do movie scores\". Due to his late introduction to music and guitar playing, Rea commented that when compared to Mark Knopfler and Eric Clapton, \"I definitely missed the boat, I think\". He was self-taught, and soon tried to join a friend's group, The Elastic Band, as the first choice for guitar or bass. Heeding his father's advice he did not join as his potential earnings would not be enough to cover the costs of being in the group. As a result, he found himself working casual labouring jobs, including working in his father's ice cream business. Rea commented that, at that time, he was \"meant to be developing my father's ice-cream cafe into a global concern, but I spent all my time in the stockroom playing slide guitar\".\nIn 1973 he joined the local Middlesbrough band, Magdalene, which earlier had included David Coverdale who had left to join Deep Purple. He began writing songs for the band and took up singing only because the singer in the band failed to show up for a playing engagement. Rea then went on to form the band The Beautiful Losers which received Melody Maker's Best Newcomers award in 1973. He secured a solo recording deal with independent Magnet Records, and released his first single entitled \"So Much Love\" in 1974. The band itself split up in 1977. In 1977 he performed on Hank Marvin's album The Hank Marvin Guitar Syndicate and also guested on Catherine Howe's EP The Truth of the Matter. He recorded his first album that same year, but according to Michael Levy (co-founder of Magnet) the recordings were literally burned and started over again because it did not capture his whole talent.\nDudgeon also produced Rea's second album Deltics (1979). Rea recorded his self-produced third album, Tennis (1980), with musicians from Middlesbrough, and it received positive reviews. As both albums had failed commercially, Magnet rejected the artwork Rea wanted for the cover of his fourth album, 1981's Chris Rea (produced by Jon Kelly, who later oversaw Rea's most successful albums). None of these albums reached the Top 50 in the UK, with his singles also delivering lacklustre performances. Diamonds reached No. 44 in the US, and Loving You went to No. 88 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rea had a difficult working relationship with Dudgeon and the other \"men in suits\" who he felt \"smoothed out\" the blues-influenced elements of his music. Rea \"always thought that [producers] knew best. I never thought for a minute that they might have another agenda\", but \"all of a sudden I was the goose that laid the golden egg, and it was hell for me\". He ruefully acknowledges, \"I can't blame anyone but myself. I gave them what they wanted rather than what I wanted\".\nRea is married to Joan Lesley, with whom he has been in a relationship since they met as teenagers on 6 April 1968 in their native Middlesbrough. They have two daughters, Josephine, born 16 September 1983, and Julia Christina, born 18 March 1989. Josephine lectures on Renaissance art in Florence and Julia studied at the University of St Andrews. Rea used to live at Cookham, Berkshire, where he owned Sol Mill Recording Studios and produced some of his later albums. When he is not writing songs, other interests particularly include painting. Rea says that he likes to \"read a lot and even though I chose music, journalism was my first passion. I wanted to be a journalist and write about car racing [...] somewhere deep down I believe I could have been a decent journalist\".\n",

Luke Spencer began as a hit man and later became a rapist who fell in love with and subsequently married his victim, Laura Webber (played by Genie Francis). His portrayal of Luke Spencer on General Hospital was well received and grew into a full contract role. The 1981 on-screen wedding of his character and Laura Webber holds the record as the highest-rated soap opera episode of all time.He holds the distinction of winning a record eight Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. He was first nominated in 1980 and had his first win in 1982. Geary was nominated again in 1983, before leaving the show in 1984. Over the next several years he took roles in various theater and television productions, as well as in several films, but not at the level of success he had hoped for. Despite the popularity of his work as Luke Spencer, filmmakers such as Oliver Stone pigeonholed Geary based solely on the fact that he was a \"soap actor\". In a conscious effort to distance himself from General Hospital, he actively sought a role in \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's film debut UHF (1989), that of the quietly eccentric scientist Philo (named for television pioneer Philo Farnsworth). Geary, a fan of Yankovic, went so far as to grow his hair out like Albert Einstein's and stay in character as Philo when meeting the film's casting team; he immediately landed the role.\n\nIn 1991, Geary returned to General Hospital as Luke's cousin and look-alike Bill Eckert, due to the actor's desire to play someone other than Luke. However, due to poor feedback from the viewing public, the character was killed off and Geary resumed the role of Luke in 1993. Tony appeared in more than 50 stage plays, including an award-winning one-man show titled Human Scratchings in 1996.

He is the father of award-winning author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates.",
        "early_life": "W. Paul Coates was born in West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Edna Coates and Douglas Cryor. Leaving high school early, Coates enlisted in the US Army; he found himself the target of harassment and racism, but he also happened upon Richard Wright's memoir Black Boy, enlightening reading that led Coates to discover other black writers, such as Malcolm X, Dick Gregory, and James Baldwin. In 1965 Coates was sent to serve in Vietnam, where he worked as a military policeman in a K-9 unit, until his discharge after 18 months, in 1967.On his return to the US, he settled in Baltimore, Maryland, and began working as a volunteer in the Black Panther Party's breakfast program. Becoming defense captain of the Baltimore Black Panthers, he was \"in charge of managing all all Panther activities in Maryland, including implementing free clothing and free food programs and housing assistance, before leaving the organisation in 1971.\"In 1972, with other activists, he established the George Jackson Prison Movement to bring Afrocentric literature to inmates, aiming to \"retrieve the souls and minds of the incarcerated\". The program was run from a bookstore Coates and another former Panther set up in 1973, called The Black Book, and he subsequently turned his efforts to founding in 1978 the Black Classic Press (BCP), characterised as \"a mission-driven publishing venture focused on preserving the collective story of African-American people\". Originally headquartered in the basement of his home, with the company's first publications being pamphlets printed on a photocopier, BCP would survive over decades to become one of the longest-running continuous African-American book publishers, alongside Haki Madhubuti's Third World Press.Utilizing the GI Bill that paid veterans to attend college, Coates earned a BA degree in community development from the Homestead Montebello Center of Antioch University in Baltimore, in 1979, and went on to obtain a master's degree in library science from Clark Atlanta University, in 1980, after which he worked at Howard University's Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, until 1991. He is co-editor with Elinor Des Verney Sinnette of Black Bibliophiles and Collectors: Preservers of Black History (1990, Howard University Press).In 1995, Coates launched BCP Digital Printing to specialize in short-run printing, about which he said in 2018: \"There are many publishing companies, but there's still only one Black book printing company in this country that I know of and that's Black Classic Press.\"An impactful landmark for BCP came in 1997, when award-winning author Walter Mosley granted the company publication rights to his novel Gone Fishin' \u2013 deliberately opting for an independent black publisher and waiving his customary six-figure advance \u2013 and the novel became one of BCP's most successful titles, with sales of more than 100,000 copies. Among other notable contemporary and historic authors on the list are John Henrik Clarke, E. Ethelbert Miller, Yosef Ben-Jochannan, Dorothy B. Porter, Amiri Baraka, Larry Neal, W. E. B. Du Bois, Edward Blyden, J. E. Casely Hayford, Bobby Seale, John G. Jackson, Carter Woodson, and J. A. Rogers, with the press specializing in obscure and significant works by and about people of African descent. As Coates says in the mission statement of BCP: \"We began publishing because we wanted to extend the memory of what we believe are important books that have helped in meaningful ways to shape the Black diasporic experience and our understanding of the world.\"Coates is a founding member and chair of the National Association of Black Book Publishers, and has served as adjunct instructor of African American Studies at Sojourner-Douglass College in Baltimore.\nCoates has seven biological children, as well as two children through his third marriage, in 2010. His son Ta-Nehisi writes about growing up with his father in a well-received 2008 memoir and tribute, entitled The Beautiful Struggle. In the Los Angeles Times, Lynell George summarized the book by saying: \"What overshadows all is his father's presence, his omnipresence\u2014the profile and teachings of a man who had a strong hand in the rearing of his progeny, both his intimate circle and the extended family of African Americans traversing an uncertain landscape. His guiding principle was simple: 'I'm not here to be your friend. My job is to get you through. To make you conscious of the world around you. To teach lessons that can carry over.'\"The 2020 book The Brother You Choose: Paul Coates and Eddie Conway Talk About Life, Politics, and The Revolution, written by Susie Day, is an exploration of the friendship forged during prison visits that Coates made to support Eddie Conway, a former associate through the Black Panther Party, who had been wrongfully convicted and was incarcerated for more than four decades, until his release on parole in 2014.\n",

He wrote more than 30 books in Malayalam and English and published 400 papers which collectively form a comprehensive economic history of Kerala's last 7 decades.Former Kerala finance minister T. M. Thomas Isaac said that Oommen was one of the pioneers who wrote extensively on the role of land reform in Kerala enhancing the capacity of the people of Kerala and in removing the barriers to it. While he is proud of the changes that land reform has brought to Kerala, he is also one of the first scholars to point out its limitations, added Isaac.Oommen's 2008 study on the role of the Kutumbashree movement in uplifting the social status of women in Kerala is important in this regard. This report has been prepared by studying 7000 Kudumbahsree member families.\n",

Waage is an expert on the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict and Norway\u2013Israel relations.",

She became a professor at the University of Oslo in 2007. Before this, Waage worked at the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), mostly as a researcher but also as acting director (September 1992 \u2013 April 1993) and deputy director (1996\u20132005).Waage has produced foundational contributions to Norwegian scholarship on Norway's role in the Oslo process of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during the early to mid-1990s. She has also been critical of the doctoral thesis of former Norwegian State Secretary Jan Egeland, who was intimately involved with the Oslo negotiations, and has used the Oslo process to demonstrate what she calls \"the limits of third-party mediation by a small state in highly asymmetrical conflicts,\" in contradiction to Egeland's thesis.Part of the Oslo process involved the famous back-channel negotiations, which were mediated by Norway. In 2001, Waage was commissioned by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to conduct a comprehensive study of this back channel. In order to carry out the research, she was granted privileged access to all relevant, still-classified files in the ministry\u2019s archives. The MFA had been at the heart of the Oslo process, but when Waage set to work at the archives she was surprised to discover \"not a single scrap of paper for the entire period from January to September 1993\u2014precisely the period of the backchannel talks.\" Such documentation does exist, and has been quoted by Israeli accounts of the Oslo process, but attempts to uncover it have failed, and significant amounts of documentation held by, inter alia, former Foreign Minister Johan J\u00f8rgen Holst has been refused access to. Waage and others speculate that such documentation has been kept hidden for party-political reasons, to avoid upsetting Israeli and US sensitivities about Israel's stance during the Oslo process, and for the vested interests of the Norwegian officials involved: Waage describes Norway under the guidance of Terje R\u00f8d-Larsen, his wife Mona Juul, Jan Egeland and Johan J\u00f8rgen Holst as \"Israel's helpful errand boy.\"Waage divides her country's role at Oslo into two phases. In the first, \"the Norwegians played only the role of a very modest facilitator\"; however, during the second, from May 1993 after the Israelis upgraded the status of the Oslo talks:\n\nNorway was . . . also an active mediator. . . . But its mediation role did not involve being on equal terms with each of the involved parties. . . . No evidence has been found showing or even suggesting that the Norwegians argued in the same way towards the Israelis as they did towards the Palestinians. . . . There appears to have been a striking lack of even-handedness on the part of the Norwegians in terms of attempts to persuade the Israeli actors to see the Palestinian point of view or revealing to the PLO where the Palestinians might have had their best negotiating chances. . . . The result achieved in 1993, the Oslo Agreement, was not an ordinary peace agreement. In essence, it was more of a timetable, a point of departure with many vaguely formulated intentions. PLO leader Arafat's willingness to accept the Oslo Accord, with all its shortcomings and compromises, was clearly a result of his fear of being permanently marginalized.:\u200a165\u20136\u200aWaage also comments about the real power that Norway had in the meetings. She in the last paragraph of her paper \"Postscript to Oslo\" says that:Without the power to impose solutions, and above all dependent on the stronger party, the weak state mediator in unequal contests must rely heavily on \u201cprocess symmetry,\u201d where the two sides are treated with absolute equality, provided with exactly the same accommodations, allotted exactly the same amount of time to make their case, and so on. The Norwegians went to great lengths to achieve this symmetry (as did the Americans in their mediating efforts between Palestinians and Israelis, albeit for different reasons). The problem with process symmetry is that it cannot address the power asymmetry that inevitably distorts the outcome of negotiations. Process symmetry and the entrie [sic] facilitative exercise can create a sense of equality between adversaries and the illusion of genuine communication, even trust. The Norwegians believed that through dialogue and a gradual building of trust, an irreversible peace dynamic would be created that could push the process forward to solution. The problem with this entire approach is that the issue is not one of trust, but of power. The facilitative process masks that reality. In the end, the results that can be achieved by a weak third-party facilitator are no more than the strong party will allow. Short of unusual generosity or truly far-sighted vision, such a solution can only be unbalanced and unfair, and therefore ultimately unsustainable. The question to be asked is whether such a model can ever be appropriate.\n",

Following high school, Furuhara attended the Kanda University of International Studies, where she spent up to 14 hours per day speaking English, and later a flight attendant school for Air Canada in Vancouver. She returned to Japan as Air Canada required at least three years of work experience, and worked as an English conversation teacher in Osaka.Furuhara started creating music when she was 22 when she returned to Japan. Inspired by the music she heard in Canada and having some experience using GarageBand, she decided to start a Tokyo-based electropop band called Go Retro with her friend Shiori Ogawa in 2013. Her bandmate Ogawa played the drums and used a Kaoss Pad for their live performances, while Furuhara performed on the synthesizer. Furuhara decided to start singing as the band's vocalist, so that she could lessen the work that Ogawa needed to do. The band released two demos and performed concerts around the Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka areas, and received a development contract from a record label, where Furuhara was given vocal training lessons. After a year together, the band broke up, as Ogawa decided to return home to Osaka.Shortly after Go Retro's dissolution in 2014, Furuhara was approached by a DJ called Takuma, and together they formed the group Eemie, producing exclusively English-language music.

Yearwood commented that the separation was \"difficult\" in a 1999 interview with Country Weekly, \"Since I do hang on to the past with my fingernails, divorce was difficult...It's a serious decision involving someone you're tied to emotionally, so it's hard to move on. And it's easy to drag things out so you don't have to face people talking about you.\"Yearwood and Garth Brooks had been friends and musical partners before romantically seeing each other. According to Brooks, his first encounter with Yearwood felt like \"that feeling when you just meet your wife\". During this period, Yearwood and Brooks were both married to other people. For these reasons, they remained friends during the first half of their careers. Following Brooks's divorce and Yearwood's second divorce, the two began dating around 2000. They became engaged in 2005 when Brooks proposed to Yearwood onstage amidst a crowd of 7,000 in Bakersfield, California. The pair married on December 10, 2005. The wedding took place at the couple's home in Owasso, Oklahoma. Brooks's three children were also part of the wedding ceremony.According to Yearwood, the pair made a commitment not to spend time apart. It is estimated by Yearwood that the couple spends about five days away from each other per year.

He became known to a wider audience as the original bass player in Public Image Ltd (PiL) in the late 1970s and early 1980s; he left the band after two albums.\nFollowing his departure from PiL, he developed a solo career. In 2012, he reunited with fellow PiL guitarist Keith Levene for Metal Box in Dub and the album Yin & Yang. Since 2013, he has been one of the featured pundits on Sunday morning's The Virtual Jukebox segment of BBC Radio 5 Live's Up All Night with Dotun Adebayo. His autobiography, Memoirs of a Geezer, was published in 2009.",
        "early_life": "Wardle was born in Stepney, East London, His father, Harry Eugene Wardle, worked as a postman, while his mother, Kathleen Bridget (n\u00e9e Fitzgibbon), was a school and County Hall secretary. Wobble grew up with his family in Whitechapel's Clichy Estate in London's East End. He is a long-time friend of John Lydon (Johnny Rotten) whom he had met in the 1970s at London's Kingsway College. The two formed half of the group of friends known as \"The Four Johns\", along with John Grey and John Simon Ritchie (later known as Sid Vicious). Jah Wobble acquired his stage name through the drunken, mumbled version of Wardle's name by Sid Vicious, which Wobble kept because \"people would never forget it\".\nIn his early life and career, by his own admission, Wardle was given to occasional bouts of aggression, exacerbated by heavy drinking and drug use. As a result, he ended up living in a squat with John Gray in West London, whilst Lydon formed The Sex Pistols. With admittedly large \"builders hands\", he had experimented with the guitar, but found playing bass a more connected and whole body experience, influenced in part by admiring Bob Marley's and The Wailers bassist Aston \"Family Man\" Barrett on stage in 1975. Wardle was as critical of his friend Vicious's bass playing as John Lydon, and had hence played in experimentation sessions with Lydon. After he burned the furniture of his squat-mates in order to stay warm, they left him alone there with a mattress, a headboard and his Music Man-copy bass.\nSoon after leaving PiL, Wobble formed The Human Condition with guitarist Dave \"Animal\" Maltby and PiL's original drummer, Jim Walker. The Human Condition toured the UK, Europe, and US in 1981, and made two cassette-only releases of their live shows (Live at the Collegiate Theatre and Live in Europe). The post-PiL years saw Wobble also collaborating with Can members Holger Czukay and Jaki Liebezeit on Czukay's solo projects (notably On the Way to the Peak of Normal and Rome Remains Rome) and Full Circle (released in 1984).In 1983, Wardle appeared on the LP Snake Charmer billed as a co-leader alongside guitarist The Edge of U2, Czukay, Liebezeit, and producer Fran\u00e7ois Kevorkian.Jah Wobble's Invaders of the Heart was formed in 1982. The original line-up was Ollie Marland on keys (who went on to become Tina Turner's musical director), Annie Whitehead on trombone, Neville Murray on percussion and a musician named only as Cliff, on drums. By 1983 Lee Partis was the drummer. Trumpeter Harry Beckett and pedal steel player B. J. Cole regularly performed with the group.By 1985 Jah Wobble's heavy drinking and drunken brawls were having an effect on his life. Halfway through the recording of the album Psalms (October 1986), Wobble stopped drinking. From then through to the present day he has remained 'clean and sober'.He then did a variety of day jobs, whilst continuing to perform and record his music in what spare time he had. These jobs included a long stretch with the London Underground. In an oft-quoted tale, it is related that he once, at Tower Hill Underground Station via the public address system, regaled commuters with the deadpan announcement, \"I used to be somebody. I repeat, I used to be somebody.\"By 1987, due to the repeated prompting of his friend and former bandmate, percussionist Neville Murray, Wobble reformed The Invaders of the Heart. Armed with a live recording of a concert he had made with a new line-up of musicians during a European tour in 1988, Wobble travelled to New York City's New Music Seminar in 1989 to get back into the music industry. Wobble was able to secure an eleventh-hour record deal with a small European record label. The live album, Without Judgement, recorded in the Netherlands was released in November 1989 and successfully revived Wobble's career.\nFollowing the success of Jah Wobble's Invaders of the Heart albums Without Judgement in 1990 and Rising Above Bedlam in 1991, Wobble has collaborated with many musicians - Brian Eno among them - & his explorations into world music predated much of the genre's popularity. Jah Wobble's 1994 album Take Me To God was influenced by world music genres and contributions from a variety of artists of diverse cultural backgrounds, including Baaba Maal, Dolores O'Riordan, and Chaka Demus, and was a critical and commercial success. His music has spanned a number of genres, including ambient music and dance music, and in 2003, reworkings of traditional English folk songs. Although he has released recordings since the late seventies Wobble has been particularly prolific from the mid-1990s to the present. He now runs his own label, 30 Hertz Records, and tours regularly throughout the UK and Europe with his current band, Jah Wobble & The Invaders of the Heart.\nWobble was part of the industrial music supergroup The Damage Manual, which formed in 2000 and consisted of Wobble on bass alongside former PiL and Killing Joke drummer Martin Atkins, Killing Joke guitarist Geordie Walker, and vocalist Chris Connelly (who had previously worked with Atkins as part of two other industrial music supergroups, Pigface and Murder Inc., the latter of which also featured Walker). He appeared on the group's self-titled debut album as well as the EP One, both of which were released on Atkins' Invisible Records label, but subsequently left the group after declining to participate in their tour of the U.S.\nA collaboration with his wife, the Chinese-born guzheng player Zi Lan Liao, was entitled Chinese Dub. He also performed at the 2008 Rhythm Festival.\nJah Wobble and the Chinese Dub Orchestra won the Cross-Cultural Collaboration category, for their album Chinese Dub, in the inaugural Songlines Music Awards, announced on 1 May 2009, which were the new world music awards organised by the UK based magazine, Songlines.\nIn September 2009, John Lydon reformed PiL for a series of concerts in late 2009. Despite Lydon's invitation to join, Jah Wobble did not feature in the line-up, since he considered the wages offered insufficient and disagreed with the choice of venues.At an impromptu appearance at the Musicport Festival in Bridlington Spa on 24 October 2010, where they were joined by vocalist Johnny Rotter of the Sex Pistols Experience, Wobble renewed his association with former PiL guitarist Keith Levene.\nIn 2011, Wobble collaborated with Julie Campbell, alias Warp Records artist LoneLady in a project called Psychic Life. The eponymous debut album Psychic Life was inspired by disco, post-punk and psychogeography, and released by Cherry Red Records on 14 November 2011. Keith Levene contributed to three tracks on the album. A digital-only EP, Psychic Life, fronted by the song \"Tightrope\", was released in October 2011.\nIn early 2012, after some planned Japan gigs were cancelled because of visa issues, Wobble and Levene played various UK clubs as Metal Box in Dub.  The visa issues were resolved and they played Fuji Rock festival in July 2012. This was followed by the release of a four-song, eponymous EP. An album entitled Yin & Yang was released in November 2012.Wobble has also collaborated with the British ambient group Marconi Union, the results of which were released as an album called Anomic on 30 Hertz records in June 2013. In October 2013, 30 Hertz Records released Odds & Sods & Epilogues, an illustrated book/CD of Jah Wobble's poetry.\nIn 2015, Cherry Red Records released Redux, a six-CD box set that spans nearly four decades of Wobble's music. It includes new tracks Merry Go Round and Let's Go Psycho. In May 2015, Jah Wobble & The Invaders of the Heart embarked on an extensive six-month UK tour. They recorded the album The Usual Suspects which was released on 3m Music in 2017. A series of gigs in England from January to May 2017 was announced.\nWobble has four children:  including music producer Natalie Wardle from his first marriage, and two sons with his second wife, the Chinese-born guzheng player and harpist Zi Lan Liao.\n",
        "gpt_completion": "The person's decision to become a guitarist or singer was influenced by their upbringing in East London and their friendship with John Lydon (Johnny Rotten) and other musicians in the 1970s. They were also inspired by watching Aston \"Family Man\" Barrett play bass onstage with Bob Marley and The Wailers. Additionally, their experiences with heavy drinking, aggression, and drug use led them to pursue music as a way to connect with their emotions and find a more fulfilling path in life."

Until October 2013, he was an elected member of the Leadership Bureau of the NCP, an Adviser to the President, and the Leader of the NCP Caucus (Majority) in the Parliament.\nWhen South Sudan gained its independence in 2011, the government in Khartoum lost some 70% of its annual revenue from the oil industry, which is located mostly in the South, and by the summer of 2013, the government was forced to make cuts in public spending to accommodate its reduced budget. One initiative was to end the subsidy on fuel supplies, but the means was somewhat clumsy, with a single hike that raised fuel prices by about 60%, but also had a knock-on effect on many other basic commodities, due to increased transport costs. The result was that the poor took to the streets, in a series of large-scale demonstrations that were also poorly handled by the government, with large numbers of protesters being shot dead by the authorities. Atabani was the lead-signatory among 31 reformers who sent a memorandum to the president, deploring the killings and advising a different response the situation. The government was not appreciative and the NCP members were suspended.\nIn October 2013, the 31 signatories, led by Dr. Atabani, announced that they were resigning from the NCP, to found a new party. The key figures, alongside Dr. Atabani, included former Sports Minister Hassan Osman Riziq and the assembly-member Fadlallah Ahmed Abdallah.\n",

        "early_life": "Boaden was born on 1 March 1956 in Colchester in Essex. Her father was an FE lecturer in geography and then worked for a teaching union. She says that she came \"from one of those families where there was quite a lot of shouting and plates whizzing through the air\".Boaden says that she found school \"a great relief from home life because it was calm and ordered\". She was educated at Rushmere junior school and Northgate Grammar School (now Northgate High School) in the large county town of Ipswich in Suffolk, and at Cedars Grammar School (now Cedars Upper School) in the town of Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire, followed by the University of Sussex, where she gained a BA Honours in English literature, and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1999, where she gained an MBA.\nBoaden began her career in 1978 as a care assistant with disturbed adolescents in the London Borough of Hackney. The following year, she became a journalist with the New York City radio station WBAI. On returning to the UK, she took a course in radio journalism at the London College of Printing (now the London College of Communication). After work at Radio Tees and Radio Aire, Boaden joined the BBC in 1983 as a news producer with Radio Leeds. From there, she joined BBC Radio 4 as a reporter on the File on 4 series, then as its editor from 1991. She worked from the BBC in Manchester as a presenter for Woman's Hour and later presented other documentaries for Radio 4, and for the Brass Tacks political programme on BBC 2.\nIn 1997, Boaden became the BBC's Head of Business Programmes, then in 1998 Head of BBC Current Affairs \u2013 the first woman to hold this position. She was Controller of BBC Radio 4 from March 2000 until 20 September 2004, superseded by Mark Damazer. She became Controller of BBC7 in 2002, when the station was launched. In 2004, she succeeded Richard Sambrook as Director of BBC News.\nBoaden received criticism following the 7 July terror attacks in London when she issued a memo instructing BBC staff not to refer to the perpetrators as terrorists, arguing that the term \"can be a barrier rather than aid to understanding\". Former BBC reporter Martin Bell was one of those who condemned the memo, accusing the BBC of being \"overcautious\" and noting that the attackers seemed to meet the definition of terrorists. Writing in The Spectator, Michael Vestey suggested \"it's almost as if the BBC is afraid of offending suicide bombers in the Muslim world\".In December 2012, Boaden was asked to temporarily step down from her position as the Director of BBC News while the BBC awaited the results of Operation Yewtree, a wide-ranging police investigation of sexual abuse, primarily of children, by former BBC presenter Jimmy Savile (who died in 2011) and others. A second and parallel investigation, launched by the BBC into possible management failings at the corporation, called the 'Pollard Report' after the lead investigator, Nick Pollard (a former senior executive at Sky News), criticised the BBC and several executive members for continuing with plans to celebrate Savile's life, despite apparently having received advance information that Savile was being investigated for multiple cases of sexual abuse. The report explicitly criticised Boaden for having handled the matter too casually. Boaden returned to her position later the same month.In February 2013, Boaden was appointed director of radio by incoming director-general Tony Hall. This was widely seen as a demotion. After a period with Fran Unsworth in her former post, James Harding became Director of BBC News later in 2013. Boaden resigned from the BBC in September 2016.She is a Fellow of The Radio Academy.In May 2019, she joined the board of the UK Statistics Authority for a period of three years.\nBoaden is married and owns a home in Scarborough. Her husband is a newspaper journalist.\n",

Additionally, their early experiences as a care assistant, journalist, and news producer may have sparked their interest in storytelling and the media industry, ultimately motivating them to pursue a career as a director or author. Lastly, the person's role as the Controller of BBC Radio 4 and Director of BBC News showcased their leadership abilities and passion for broadcasting, which could have influenced their decision to become a director or author in order to have creative control and tell stories in their own voice."

Earning his Ph.D. from Rice University in Texas on protein evolution, including that of CRISPR, He learned gene-editing techniques (CRISPR/Cas9) as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University in California.He Jiankui became widely known in November 2018 after he had claimed that he had created the first human genetically edited babies, twin girls known by their pseudonyms, Lulu and Nana. The announcement in November 2018 of Lulu and Nana, who were born by mid-October 2018, was initially praised in the press as a major scientific advancement. But following scrutiny on how the experiment was executed, He received widespread condemnation, and on 29 November 2018, Chinese authorities suspended his research activities. On January 21, 2019, he was fired by SUSTech.In May 2019, lawyers in China reported, in light of the purported creation by He Jiankui of the first gene-edited humans, the drafting of regulations that anyone manipulating the human genome by gene-editing techniques would be held responsible for any related adverse consequences. In December 2019, MIT Technology Review reported an overview of the controversy to date, including excerpts of the unpublished research manuscript.

With the support of social philanthropists, we will overcome three to five genetic diseases within two to three years to benefit families with rare diseases.\" His first plan is to make a gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy that causes gradual muscle degeneration particularly in boys. He also said on a microblogging site, Weibo, that he had applied for government funding for a DNA synthesiser project, commenting: \"[I will] continue the scientific research and serve the country...

His artistic performances included The Little Worm in the Ear, in Yangon, and Guitarist in 1996.\nHtein Lin spent 6\u00bd years as a political prisoner in Burma from 1998-2004. He continued to perform for fellow inmates in prison. Officially, he was not permitted to paint while imprisoned. However, he  managed to produce several hundred paintings secretly, using white cotton prison uniforms, as well as about a thousand drawings. He bribed the prison guards to smuggle paint to him, but it was too dangerous to have a paintbrush in his cell. Instead, he used various objects that were available to him, including cigarette lighters, pieces of glass, plates, nets, razor blades, syringes, or simply his fingers and hands. He used a monoprint technique.\nAfter his release from prison in 2004, he returned to art and performance. His May 2005 Rangoon street performance entitled Mobile Art Gallery/Mobile Market meant he was interrogated by the authorities again.\nHe was introduced in 2005 to the British Ambassador in Yangon, Vicky Bowman, who took receipt of his prison paintings and ensured their preservation by loaning them to  the Burma Archives Project at the International Institute of Social History  in Amsterdam. He later married Bowman and they moved to live in London for seven years.\nDuring his time in the UK, Htein Lin undertook performance art in Trafalgar Square, central London, on 1 June 2008.He also had exhibitions and performed in Finland, France, Norway, Thailand, Czech Republic and the United States of America. In addition, he has performed at the 2007 Venice Biennale and at festivals in Finland, Japan, Malaysia, and the Philippines. His performances draw on his artistic life as well as aiming to raise awareness of the Burmese political situation.\nHtein Lin has continued to use the monoprint technique in his subsequent paintings. These draw on his Theravada Buddhist faith, Burmese symbols and traditions, his early experience as a comedian in \"anyeint\" satirical performances, and events such as Cyclone Nargis and the Saffron Revolution.\nIn 2013, Htein Lin returned to live in Rangoon, and commenced his project A Show of Hands Project. In 2014 he returned one week in prison to train prisoners to Vipassana meditation and monoprint painting techniques  In November 2015, Htein Lin campaigned in the delta area for the National League for Democracy of Aung San Suu Kyi  and his native township Ingapu.\nIn the aftermath of the 2021 Myanmar coup d'\u00e9tat, he was reportedly detained in Yangon on 24 August 2022, along with his wife Vicky Bowman, and charged with immigration offences. PEN America called for his immediate release. He was released in November 2022, as part of a mass pardon to mark National Day.\nHe is married to the former British Ambassador to Myanmar, Vicky Bowman, and they have one daughter.\n",
        "gpt_completion": "Htein Lin's decision to become an artist and painter was influenced by his involvement in protests and his opposition to the Burmese military regime. He studied with an artist and learned about western artists, which expanded his artistic knowledge and skills. His experience as a political prisoner and the restrictions he faced in prison led him to develop innovative techniques and use unconventional materials, further shaping his artistic style."

Saab was the subject of journalistic investigations for conducting businesses estimated at US$135 million with the Venezuelan government, while other Colombian businessmen had stopped exporting to Venezuela due to uncertainty regarding payments and tight exchange controls. Saab's name has appeared in multiple ICIJ leaks including the Panama Papers, Pandora Papers and the FinCEN Files.Saab was enriched by the materials supplier business of the Housing Mission in Venezuela. Armando.Info, a Venezuelan investigative journalist outlet, reported that Saab received US$159 million from the Venezuelan government to import housing materials between 2012 and 2013, but only delivered products worth US$3 million. He later sold food to Venezuela for more than US$200 million in a contract signed by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The food was later resold in Venezuela for 112% more than its original price.Saab has been investigated by Colombian authorities for allegedly laundering US$25,000 million between 2004 and 2011. On 8 May 2019, the Office of the Attorney General of Colombia indicted Saab with charges of money laundering, concert to commit crimes, illicit enrichment, fictitious exports and imports, and aggravated fraud for events related to his Shatex company. During the course of these investigations, his accounting auditors were arrested and charged by the prosecutor's office.During a fuel stop at Cape Verde, Alex Saab was arrested while on his way from Venezuela to Iran on a business jet on 12 June 2020. Saab was arrested in accordance to an Interpol red notice in relation to his indictment in United States, accused of money laundering. Saab's extradition to the United States was approved by the Barlovento Appeals Tribunal, Cape Verde's Supreme Court of Justice and its Constitutional Court.The Venezuelan government denied or ignored any relationship with Saab for years, but after his arrest in Cape Verde it started deploying a support campaign in favour of Saab and to prevent his extradition, using government social media accounts and filling Caracas with billboards, murals and graffitis asking for his release, organizing demonstrations in his support, and starting a YouTube series about him.He was extradited to the United States on 16 October 2021 and charged with eight counts of money laundering, accused of moving $350 million out of Venezuela into accounts controlled in the United States and other countries, as well as falsifying documents to obtain contracts for the construction of affordable housing, facing up to twenty years in prison. Maduro's government suspended negotiation talks with the political opposition as a response. According to court documents released in 2022, Saab became a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) informant in 2018, during which time he shared information about the bribes that he offered to Venezuelan officials and contracts with the government.",
        "early_life": "Alex Saab is the son of a Lebanese immigrant, Luis, who settled in the city of Barranquilla and opened various businesses, including Textiles Saab, finding success in Colombia's textile industry. Alex Saab attended the German School of Barranquilla, an elite private school.Saab began his career in Barranquilla at age 18, selling business promotional keychains and subsequently work uniforms. By the time he was 19, he had opened a T-shirt factory.In the early 2000, he formed a network of export organisations with family members listed as officers. Saab joined a group of Colombian businessmen who were exporting merchandise to Colombia from Venezuela using the CADIVI currency system. According to a Univisi\u00f3n source, during this time Saab accumulated million dollar debts after the suspension of foreign exchange payments by the Venezuelan government, which in turn alleged that some businessmen in the country had cheated millions from the Cadivi system, although Saab was not accused of such fraud. Saab sued Univisi\u00f3n's journalist Gerardo Reyes in the US after Reyes reported on these issues.Saab was also enriched due to the materials supplier business of the Housing Mission in Venezuela. According to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), in 2009 Saab and his business partner \u00c1lvaro Pulido won \"an overvalued government contract to build 25,000 units of low-income housing for three or four-times the worth of the original construction cost.\" From 2011, Saab worked with Maduro's stepsons, Walter, Yosser and Yoswal, known as Los Chamos, because of their access to Maduro and former Vice President Tareck El Aissami, to secure government contracts.On 28 November 2011, Saab's Bogota-based company Fondo Global de Construccion (Global Construction Fund) signed an agreement with the Venezuelan government, which resulted in a contract of US$685 million for the construction of prefabricated homes in Venezuela as part of la Gran Misi\u00f3n Vivienda housing programme, The signing was attended by presidents Juan Manuel Santos and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and Venezuela's then Foreign Minister Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Saab's lawyer, Abelardo De La Espriella, said that Saab had no connection with the Global Construction Fund. Armando.Info, a Venezuelan investigative journalist outlet, reported that Saab received US$159 million from the Venezuelan government to import housing materials between 2012 and 2013, but only delivered products worth US$3 million. The company was investigated by Ecuador's government for alleged money laundering through false exports to Venezuela via Colombia; although Saab was not accused of wrongdoing, in 2013 Ecuadorian prosecutors alleged the company was used to launder more than $130 million, but the case was dropped after several years. A parallel investigation by Colombia's customs agency was dropped in 2014 when the investigator resigned and moved abroad due to death threats.In 2014, Antigua and Barbuda's prime minister Gaston Browne invited Saab to become special economic envoy to Venezuela, granting him Antiguan citizenship. He had a contract to build a factory in Antigua to make housing panels, but the factory never opened.Saab used the services of Mossack Fonseca, the legal firm at the center of the Panama Papers offshore financing scandal, to create companies abroad. Among these were Seafire Foundation, Lintel Overseas and PI Proment International Sociedad An\u00f3nima Kingstone Team Inc. Saab's lawyer said none of these companies were ever used. Among the companies there also was Group Grand Limited, of which Saab was co-owner of and was used to supply food to the Local Committees for Supply and Production (CLAP) programme.In August 2015, a tiny trucking and trading firm, Trenaco, headquartered in Switzerland but largely run out of Colombia, won a contract from Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), worth around $4.5 billion, for a drilling project in the Orinoco Belt, the world's largest crude oil reserve. After complaints from PDVSA's foreign partners, including Chevron and Rosneft, the deal collapsed by the start of 2016. Trenaco executives told Reuters that Saab had run the company since 2012-14. The company shared an address with Fondo Global, and executives said Saab worked alongside Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez, the son of a Colombian agricultural magnate, and Colombian businessman Alvaro Pulido.In 2019, Saab launched two legal cases in Miami against the Univision TV network for its reporting of his businesses. By 2020, Saab had moved his base of operations to Turkey.\n",

A few years later, Kobashiri's submission to a female-orientated label reached the final round.

As a technical high school graduate, where she was the only female student in her class, she says she cannot write novels based on school life.In describing her how she writes, Kobashiri says that she first creates the characters before molding the setting and storyline around them. In addition, she says she is always conscious of her prose's rhythm and the tempo of her story, being careful not to distract the reader with minutiae, especially during dialogue, and avoids using difficult words and kanji as much as possible.\n",

She served as leader of the Israeli Labor Party between 2011 and 2013. Before entering politics, she was a journalist, an author, and a television and radio commentator.",
        "early_life": "Yachimovich was born in Kfar Saba. Her father, Moshe, was a construction worker and her mother, Hanna, a teacher. Both parents were Holocaust survivors who immigrated to Israel from Poland. She became politically engaged at an early age, and was expelled from Ostrovsky high school in Ra'anana at age 15 for hanging up posters denouncing the principal's style of leadership. She was conscripted in 1978, and in 1985, Yachimovich graduated from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev with a degree in behavioural science.\nWhile studying in Beersheba, she worked as a correspondent for the Al HaMishmar newspaper. She went on to become an anchor for the Israel Broadcasting Authority's radio station Reshet Bet, earning a reputation as opinionated and critical of conventional wisdom and the establishment. As a journalist, she covered women's and social welfare issues. In October 2000, following a work dispute, she left her radio job and joined  Channel 2 TV, where she hosted a political talk show and served as a news commentator. She also did a weekly program for Israel Army Radio (Galei Tzahal).\nOn 29 November 2005, two weeks after Amir Peretz was interviewed by Yachimovich on \"Meet the Press\" for the occasion of his election as leader of the Labor Party, Yachimovich announced she was leaving journalism and entering politics. She ran in the Labor primaries and achieved the ninth place on the party's list for the 2006 elections, in which she was elected to the Knesset.\n\nYachimovich was criticized on her sharp move from journalism to politics. Critics noted that it was inappropriate for a watchdog journalist to become a member of the system she was supposed to be guarding. Others alleged that the interview she had with Peretz shortly before joining politics must have lacked professional impartiality, according to journalism ethics. Following criticisms, a cooling-off period of three months was imposed on journalists by Israeli broadcast regulator The Second Authority in late 2005. Yachimovich later claimed on her behalf that she didn't have the slightest idea of joining politics on her mind during that interview. She also declared that she opposes any cooling-off periods on joining politics, arguing that these should instead be imposed on parliamentarians and civil servants who upon leaving the public sphere immediately join high-profile positions in the private sector, exploiting their influence to make private profits.\n\nDespite criticisms, her entry to political life was preceded and followed by numerous other Israeli journalists who ran for a Knesset seat, including Nitzan Horowitz, Yair Lapid, Nachman Shai, Uri Orbach, Ofer Shelach and Merav Michaeli. Public debate has continued to question this practice, leading to a failed Knesset bill to be debated in 2010 and again in 2012, proposing a cooling-off period of 6 months for journalists before entering politics.\nShe lives in Kerem HaTeimanim neighborhood in central Tel Aviv with her two children, Gal and Rama, in a 78 square meters apartment.  A feminist, Yachimovich reportedly refused to marry under the rabbinate religious authority. After getting divorced, she maintains good relations with her ex-husband, Noam Ziv, to whom she dedicated her last book.She published her apartment's worth, her mortgage loan worth and previous income figures, in order to promote increased transparency of elected officials' interests. Claiming she has nothing to hide, Yachimovich challenged all Members of Knesset to publish their own financial standing.Besides her native language, Hebrew, she speaks English and Polish.Yachimovich is an atheist. On Judaism, she says \"My Judaism is one of identity: I am part of a family and part of a people with a shared fate, history, culture and customs. My extended (ultra-Orthodox) family was destroyed in the Holocaust and my parents who survived were angry at God and felt betrayed.

Lu gained international prominence in 1978 for starring in the film Five Deadly Venoms which earned him and the rest of the cast the moniker Venom Mob. He was part of Chang Cheh's ensemble of fourth generation actors along with Chiang Sheng, Philip Kwok, Lo Mang, and Sun Chien.",
        "early_life": "Lu was born Chu Qi Xue on April 3, 1956, in Taipei, Taiwan. His ancestral roots can be traced back to Anhui Province in Mainland China. The youngest of four sons, Lu grew up idolizing martial arts actor Chen Kuan-tai. At age 8, he was sent to the government-run Junior Lu Guang Drama School by his parents, who were struggling to support him and his siblings. There, he studied revolutionary opera with future costar and lifelong friend, Chiang Sheng. Lu, along with Chiang, Philip Kwok, Robert Tai, and Ricky Cheng would practice acrobatics near Taipei Bridge and earned pocket money playing extras in movies that were shot nearby. In addition to learning acrobatics, Lu sang, practiced martial arts and somersaults, and became proficient in various weapons. Upon graduating, he had plans to pursue a career in the professional arts but decided on film and television instead, owing to the declining popularity of Chinese opera. An avid drinker of Coca-Cola, Lu's love of the soft drink earned him the nickname Cola King.\nLu was recruited by Chang Cheh in 1975 and briefly worked as a stuntman in movies such as Ng See-yuen's Secret Rivals 2 where much of his previous acrobatic training was applied to the action choreography. His first major role was in the 1976 film Shaolin Temple. In 1978, Lu was cast as Tang Shankui a.k.a. the Centipede in Chang's Five Deadly Venoms where he also served as one of the film's action directors. Lu recalled the experience as \"very hard to put together but we had a great time doing it. In retrospect, I have nothing but good memories.\" Five Deadly Venoms enjoyed commercial success in Hong Kong and Taiwan but especially so in North America where the main cast became collectively known by fans as the Venom Mob. Lu and his cast members, however, did not become aware of the film's international popularity until several years after its release. Following the film's success, Lu frequently starred with the Venom Mob, often in villainous roles. Amongst these films was Shaolin Rescuers (1979) for which his portrayal of the main antagonist Gao Jinzhong won him Best Supporting Actor at the 25th Asia-Pacific Film Festival in Singapore. Lu regards winning the award as the highlight of his acting career and the character remains one of his favorite roles.The Venom Mob eventually disbanded in 1981. Lu's fellow Venom actor Philip Kwok attributed the split to them simply leaving Shaw's with Chang following suit, while Lo Mang believed it was due to audiences no longer wishing to see gory heroics, preferring instead the lighter, more comedic tones of Jackie Chan films. Lu, similarly, was of the opinion that the split was caused by the decline of martial art films in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and because Chang had shifted his focus to the mainland market.\nIn 1981, Lu returned to Taiwan and cofounded a film production company with Venom costars and close friends Philip Kwok and Chiang Sheng. They starred in, directed, and choreographed the company's debut film, Ninja in the Deadly Trap. Lu's film appearances decreased after completing Shanghai 13 (1984) as he shifted primarily to television at the suggestion of his childhood friend and fellow Shaw Brothers actor, Ricky Cheng. He remains active in television where he largely directs or choreographs (sometimes both) TV series from Taiwan or Mainland China. His more notable works include New Legend of Madame White Snake (1992), My Fair Princess (1997), Legend of Dagger Li (1999), and Justice Bao (2010).\nIn 2017, Lu received the Urban Fists of Legends Legacy Award and, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Five Deadly Venoms, The Martial Arts Cult Classic Cinema Award at The Urban Action Showcase and Expo in New York City.\n",
        "gpt_completion": "The person's decision to become an actor, choreographer, or director was likely influenced by several factors. Firstly, their early exposure to martial arts films and idolizing martial arts actor Chen Kuan-tai could have sparked their passion for performing arts. Secondly, their experience studying revolutionary opera at a drama school and practicing acrobatics and martial arts further developed their skills and interest in the field. Lastly, the declining popularity of Chinese opera and the success and recognition they achieved in films like Shaolin Temple and Five Deadly Venoms may have solidified their decision to pursue a career in film and television."

He is best known for his music, which often includes social, economic, and cultural reflections on Brazil.\nThe firstborn son of S\u00e9rgio Buarque de Hollanda, Buarque lived at several locations throughout his childhood, though mostly in Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Rome. He wrote and studied literature as a child and found music through the bossa nova compositions of Tom Jobim and Jo\u00e3o Gilberto. He performed as a singer and guitarist in the 1960s as well as writing a play that was deemed dangerous by the Brazilian military dictatorship of the time. Buarque, along with several Tropicalist and MPB musicians, was threatened by the Brazilian military government and eventually left Brazil for Italy in 1969. However, he came back to Brazil in 1970, and continued to record, perform, and write, though much of his material was suppressed by government censors. He released several more albums in the 1980s and published three novels in the 1990s and 2000s.\nIn 2019, Buarque was awarded the Cam\u00f5es Prize, the most important prize for literature in the Portuguese language.\nHowever, awarding of the prize was delayed by four years due to actions by Jair Bolsonaro, but Buarque received it in April 2023.",
        "early_life": "Buarque was born in Rio de Janeiro on 19 June 1944. He came from an intellectually privileged family background\u2014his father S\u00e9rgio Buarque de Holanda was a well-known historian, sociologist and journalist and his mother Maria Am\u00e9lia Ces\u00e1rio Alvim was a painter and pianist. He is also brother of the singer Mi\u00facha and politician Ana de Hollanda. As a child, he was impressed by the musical style of bossa nova, specifically the work of Tom Jobim and Jo\u00e3o Gilberto. He was also interested in writing, composing his first short story at 18 years old and studying European literature, also at a young age. One of his most consuming interests, however, was playing football, beginning at age four, and he still played regularly in his 60s. During his childhood, he lived in Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rome.\nBefore becoming a musician, Buarque decided at one point to study architecture at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, but this choice did not lead to a career in that field; Buarque often skipped classes.\n\nHe made his public debut as musician and composer in 1964, rapidly building his reputation at music festivals and television variety shows when bossa nova came to light and Nara Le\u00e3o recorded three of his songs. His eponymous debut album exemplified his future work, with catchy sambas characterized by inventive wordplay and an undercurrent of nostalgic tragedy. Buarque had his first hit with \"A Banda\" in 1966, written about a marching band, and soon released several more singles. Although playing bossa nova, during his career, samba and M\u00fasica popular brasileira would also be widely explored. Despite that, Buarque was criticized by two of the leading musicians at the time, Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil as they believed his musical style was overly conservative. However, an existentially themed play that Buarque wrote and composed in 1968, Roda Viva (\"Live Circle\"), was frowned upon by the military government and Buarque served a short prison sentence because of it. He left Brazil for Italy for 18 months in 1970, returning to write his first novel in 1972, which was not targeted by censors.\n\nAt this time his thinly veiled protest single \"Apesar de Voc\u00ea\" (\"In spite of You\" \u2013 in reference to the military dictatorship) was also produced. \"Apesar de Voc\u00ea\" was overlooked by the military censors, becoming an important anthem in the democratic movement. After selling over 100,000 copies, the single was eventually censored and removed from the market. At one point in 1974, the censors banned any song authored by Chico Buarque. Then, he created a pseudonym, naming himself \"Julinho da Adelaide\", complete with life history and interviews to newspapers. \"Julinho da Adelaide\" authored songs such as \"Jorge Maravilha\" and \"Acorda amor\" before he was outed in a Jornal do Brasil news story. Buarque also wrote a play named Calabar, about the Dutch invasion of Brazil in the seventeenth century, drawing parallels with the military regime. Despite the censorship, songs such as \"Samba de Orly\" (1970), \"Acorda amor\" (1974, as \"Julinho da Adelaide\") manifested Buarque's continuing opposition to the military regime.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, he collaborated with filmmakers, playwrights, and musicians in further protest works against the dictatorship. Buarque approached the 1983 Concert for Peace in Nicaragua as a valid forum to vocalize his strong political views. Throughout the decade, he crafted many of his songs as vehicles to describe the re-democratization of Brazil. The Concert for Peace in Nicaragua was one in a concert series known as the \"Central American Peace Concerts.\" These concerts featured various Latin American artists. The political turmoil that plagued this era were expressed in many of Buarque's songs. He later wrote Budapeste, a novel that achieved critical national acclaim and won the Pr\u00eamio Jabuti, a Brazilian literary award comparable to the Booker Prize.\nHis 2017 album Caravanas was elected the 3rd best Brazilian album of that year by the Brazilian edition of Rolling Stone.\n",

De Biase is an American neuroscientist and glial biologist as well as an assistant professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. De Biase explores the diversity of microglia that exist within the basal ganglia circuitry to one day target regional or circuit-specific microglia in disease. De Biase's graduate work highlighted the existence and roles of neuron-OPC synapses in development and her postdoctoral work was critical in showing that microglia are not homogenous within the brain parenchyma.",
        "early_life": "De Biase pursued her undergraduate degree at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. De Biase majored in Cellular, Molecular, and Developmental Biology and received her Bachelors of Science in 2003. After completing her degree at Yale, De Biase worked as a research technician in the lab of Eric Hoffman at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. De Biase explored gene expression changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in addition to characterizing various immune cell states. Along with the Hoffman Lab, De Biase explored the gene expression of T helper cells. She found that TH2 cells express the NKG2A and CD56 upon activation while TH1 cells do not.Following her time as a researcher technician, in 2005 De Biase pursued her graduate degree at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. De Biase completed her graduate training in neuroscience under the mentorship of Dwight Bergles. She explored the synapses and signaling between neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells.De Biase first characterized the expression patterns and roles of NG2+ oligodendrocyte progenitors in the mouse brain. She found that these NG2+ cells, which go on to form oligodendrocytes later in development, have a unique early expression of voltage gated sodium channels, ionotropic glutamate receptors, and they form synapses with glutamatergic neurons. She further found that these cells exhibited low amplitude spikes, but not action potentials and that later in their development, this spiking ability was lost as well as their synaptic input and glutamate receptors. Overall her early results showed that oligodendrocyte progenitors, through their glutamatergic synapses with neurons, are able to monitor neural activity early in development before transitioning into their oligodendrocyte identities. Next, De Biase explored the role of NMDARs on oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs) in oligodendrocyte differentiation. When she knocked out NMDARs in OPCs, De Biase did not observe effects on differentiation or cell survival, but she did find significant changes in AMPAR expression, suggesting that NMDARs help to regulate AMPAR signalling with neighbouring axons in development. Overall, De Biase's graduate work highlighted the novel roles and functions of previously unknown OPC-neuron synapses in development.\nDe Biase completed her graduate training in 2011 and then pursued her postdoctoral work under the mentorship of Antonello Bonci at the National Institute on Drug Abuse. De Biase explored the diversity of microglial phenotypes across basal ganglia nuclei, which called into question prior hypotheses about the homogeneity of microglia in the central nervous system.  Her discoveries in the Bonci Lab laid the foundation for her independent career and research program.In 2018, De Biase joined the faculty at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. De Biase is an assistant professor in the Department of Physiology and is the principal investigator of the De Biase Lab. The research focus of the De Biase Lab is the development and functions of the diversity of microglia within the basal ganglia circuitry. Based on De Biase's postdoctoral work, microglia appear to be specialized to different brain regions and neural circuits, which allows for specific development of therapies for neurological and psychiatric diseases that target circuit specific microglia based on their unique gene expression, functions, and roles in disease. The De Biase Lab uses high resolution imaging techniques, electrophysiological recordings of microglia, and gene expression analyses to probe microglia in their different circuits and states in the basal ganglia.\n",

        "early_life": "Coats was born and raised in Bakersfield, California, where he graduated from Bakersfield High School in 1960 in absentia while spending his senior year abroad with the International Christian Youth Exchange in the German village of Rasdorf. While in Germany he lived with the family of Albert Martin for a year and attended the Gymnasium in H\u00fcnfeld near Fulda.\nFrom 1960 to 1962, Coats attended Bakersfield College, where he co-founded and edited the Weekly Blatt, an underground weekly campus newspaper dedicated to presenting conservative and libertarian political perspectives on current events.\nDuring 1962\u201366 Coats attended the University of California at Berkeley and received a B.A. in economics in June 1966. At Berkeley, he served as president of several organizations, including the University Young Republicans (UYR), the University Conservatives, and his fraternity, Alpha Tau Omega. As president of the UYR, he was a member of the Free Speech Movement coordinating committee and allied with the presidents of the University Young Democrats, University Conservatives, and the Young People's Socialist League in an effort to restore free speech to the campus without violence.\nIn 1966\u201370 Coats studied economics at the University of Chicago. His doctoral dissertation was on The September 1968 Changes in 'Regulation D' and Their Implications for Monetary Supply Control, with Milton Friedman  heading his dissertation committee. His Ph.D. was granted in 1972. While studying at Chicago, Coats taught part-time at the Illinois Institute of Technology (1966\u20131967 and 1968\u20131970). In 1968 he took a leave of absence to join Louise Wilkinson at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, where both were assistant professors. They married in Hawaii before returning to Chicago to resume their graduate studies. Coats has several children and grandchildren. His partner for the last 20+ years is Dr Ito Briones, a physician and artist.\nCoats was an assistant professor of economics at the University of Virginia from 1970 to 1975 and assistant chairman of the economics department in 1975.

His career focused on an intensive program of developing new central banks and currencies that lasted beyond his retirement. He has led more than 70 missions that have provided practical advice and assistance to central banks around the globe often under crisis conditions. These include missions to Afghanistan, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Hungary, Iraq,  Israel, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kyrgyz Republic, Malta, Moldova, Nigeria, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Sudan, Turkey, the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He supervised the establishment of new central banks in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the reestablishment, transformation, and development of the payment and banking systems in Kosovo, and helped Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and later Bosnia and Herzegovina and South Sudan introduce their own currencies.\nCoats\u2019 work on banking sector issues in Moldova, Bulgaria, Croatia, Turkey and Yugoslavia has provided him with the practical experience reflected in his several articles on banking sector soundness issues (including several papers on Bank Insolvency Law). He has also written on various monetary theory and policy issues, including digital money and inflation targeting. He edited a book on Inflation Targeting in Transition Economies published by the IMF and the Czech National Bank and co-edited a book on the same subject published by the Czech National Bank in 2003. The difficult negotiations he led for the IMF to establish a new central bank following the end of the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina are chronicled in his book, One Currency for Bosnia: Creating the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, published in August, 2007, by Jameson Books.Coats\u2019 monetary advice has not always been trouble free. At a widely attended press conference in Kabul in January 2002, Coats was asked by Mark Landler, a New York Times reporter whether the IMF was recommending that Afghanistan replace the existing currency with U.S. dollars. He responded that dollarization was one of the options under consideration. When he failed to explain that if the policy to dollarize were adopted then the existing currency would be redeemed for dollars, the Afghani immediately depreciated about 25%. The next day acting central bank governor Abdul Fitrat detailed more fully how the adoption of dollarization (which was rejected in any event), would work and the exchange rate recovered fully within a day.At the time he retired from the IMF in May, 2003, to become a Director of the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA), Coats was the assistant director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM). Coats was a visiting economist at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 1979 and was seconded to the World Bank for one year to help write the 1989 World Development Report on the Financial System.\nFollowing his IMF retirement, he continued providing technical assistance to central banks  as a consultant with the IMF, BearingPoint, the Asian Development Bank, the U.S. Treasury, Overseas Development Institute, and Deloitte Consulting. His consulting assignments have included Afghanistan, Albania, Iraq, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Yemen, and South Sudan.Coats is a member of Alpha Tau Omega (past president of Berkeley chapter), American Economic Association, The Mont Pelerin Society, Order of the Golden Bear, The Philadelphia Society (past member of board of directors), and the Western Economic Association International, (past member of the executive committee).His honors include Kyrgyzstan's Certificate of Honor, presented by President Askar Akaev in Bishkek in 1997, in recognition of his work to prepare Kyrgyzstan to introduce its own currency, and he was inducted into Confr\u00e9rie de la Cha\u00eene des R\u00f4tisseurs in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1999.

Ma stored over 100 million yuan in an apartment that he purchased, similar to a method used by another corrupt official Wei Pengyuan, who was given the death penalty for bribery.",
        "early_life": "Ma was born in Haigang District in Qinghuangdao, the eldest of four children. In 1985, Ma graduated from a local polytechnic college and entered the municipal water works department, where he worked as a technician in charge of furnace maintenance. He later began taking on administrative roles. In 1997, Ma was named head of the water works division of Beidaihe, a seaside resort popular with leaders of the Communist Party. In 2005, the municipal water works was re-organized into a corporation, which signed a 25-year contract with the city to maintain the water supply. Ma became its vice president in charge of its Beidaihe branch.In November 2010, the operations of the Beidaihe branch of the company was separated from that of Qinhuangdao. In the next year, the state-owned Beidaihe Water Works Corporation was founded with Ma Chaoqun as its chief executive. The company served Beidaihe as well as neighbouring counties. More importantly, the company was charged with providing water to various state and party agencies stationed in the area, including to Communist leaders during their annual summer retreat in Beidaihe. In 2012, Ma was given recognition by the province for his high performance during the summer months, named a \"Model Labourer\" by the city of Qinhuangdao.In January 2014, Ma was reported by people with links to a state-owned company in Beijing as having solicited bribes worth millions of yuan from a local hotel. On February 12, 2014, Ma was detained for a corruption investigation.  His younger brother Ma Zhongqun was detained on the same day, and his younger sister Ma Qingru was arrested a month later. On November 12, 2014, the Hebei provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection (CDI) released findings of its investigation, accusing Ma of embezzlement, bribery, and illegally moving public resources. He was arrested and faced a raft of criminal charges.The Ma case gained notoriety for the astronomical value of alleged bribes.  The Hebei CDI was said to have discovered over 120 million yuan ($19.3 million) worth of cash in Ma's home. Also unearthed was 37 kilograms of gold and 68 real estate certificates of ownership. To carry out Ma's arrest, the police mobilized the city's special operations unit, as Ma was believed to have ties with local organized crime. That Ma, merely a division-level (\u5904\u7ea7) official (i.e., rank equivalent to that of a county governor) had such a large sum stored up in his home shocked the public. Ma's mother Zhang Guiying denied that her son was corrupt, claiming that the assets were the result of years of hard work by her husband who operated a coal mine, asserting that her son was being blackmailed.Chinese media has also reported connections between Ma Chaoqun and his so-called \"godfather\", who was suspected to be a high-level official from Beijing. It has been suggested that the processing of the case has faced interference from the authorities as increasing its scope may have dragged out an 'untouchable tiger'.Ma is married to Zhang Lihuan. They had one son. Ma's name, \"Chaoqun\", means \"soars above the rest.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n",

Head had a precocious talent in art and at the age of 11 attended Reeds Art Club, a social club organised at his father's factory. He was a pupil of Maidstone Grammar School. In 1983 he began studying for a degree in Fine Art at the Aberystwyth University under the tutorship of the abstract painter David Tinker. Here he also became friends with another painter, Steve Whitehead, with whom he would later exhibit and collaborate as a teacher of art. After completing his degree, and a short period of postgraduate study at Lancaster University, Head began showing at the Colin Jellicoe Gallery in Manchester and with the flamboyant art dealer Nicholas Treadwell.\nIn 1994 Head founded and became the Chair of the Fine Art Department at the University of York's Scarborough Campus, where he again teamed up with Steve Whitehead, and became friends with the art theorist and Head of Art History Michael Paraskos. Here he also befriended the artist Jason Brooks. During this period most of Head's work was in a neo-classical figurative style, and these works were shown with those of Brooks at the Paton Gallery, London in 1995. Head then moved on to producing urban realist paintings, closer in theme and style to the work he had made as an art student in Aberystwyth.\nIn 1999 Head gave up teaching and signed to Blains Fine Art (later called the Haunch of Venison Gallery) in London and with the gallery run by the founder of the Photorealist art movement, Louis K. Meisel Fine Art in New York, even though Head was not, even in Meisel's eyes, a Photorealist painter. Nonetheless, the connection with Meisel led to Head being included in several editions of Meisel's survey books on Photorealist painting, particularly in the sections dealing with contemporary painters whom Meisel suggested had moved beyond old-fashioned Photorealism.Also stemming from the connection with Meisel, in 2003 Head joined Michael Paraskos in taking part in The Prague Project the first of a series of group visits by figurative painters to different cities  around the world, out of which paintings were produced for a group exhibition. The work produced during the Prague Project was exhibited at the Roberson Museum and Science Center, Binghamton, New York in 2004.In 2005 Head was commissioned by the Museum of London to produce a painting of Buckingham Palace to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II.However, also 2005 Head was debilitated by a neurological disease that had a devastating effect on his muscles. Despite still suffering from this condition, Head continued painting and the scale of his work became larger, but with an increasing focus on London as long-distance travel became difficult for him. With this renewed focus on the United Kingdom, in 2005 Head joined Marlborough Fine Art in London and in his work began to use London subject matter.\nIn 2007 he worked again with Michael Paraskos at the Schw\u00e4bische Kunstsommer, at the University of Augsburg, Irsee, Germany, and since then Head and Paraskos have collaborated in publishing and lecturing on what they call The New Aesthetics, and again with Paraskos as a visiting artist at the Cyprus College of Art in 2010.\nIn October and November 2010 three paintings were exhibited at the National Gallery, London, which received unusually widespread coverage for such a show, including on 29 October a segment on Radio 4's PM news magazine.In September 2012 Paraskos arranged for a display of Head's work alongside that of Nicolas Poussin at Dulwich Picture Gallery in London, and in September 2014 Head exhibited at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts in Norwich as part of the exhibition Reality: Modern and Contemporary British Painting curated by Chris Stevens.\n",

Apart from writing and directing the film, Fuad worked as the cinematographer, marking it as the first Maldivian film to be shot in high-definition digital video. Though the film received positive reviews from critics, it was a commercial failure. Co-director of the film Shifau opined that its commercial status was a result of casting \"not very prominent\" faces in the film and the \"film-goers were not ready to accept the genre\" at the time of release. Ahmed Nadheem from Haveeru praised the narration and plot of the film; \"Moomin outshone everyone from the crew. From writing to direction and camera work, Fuad has kept every little detail on his mind and arranged the whole sequences the best it can be presented\".

Beyond all the obstacles, I had to harm myself to complete filming Happy Birthday and I never intend on developing a similar project in the near future\". At 1st Maldives Film Awards ceremony, Fuad was bestowed with Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Original Song, Best Costume Designer and Best Sound Mixing award.

In 1978, he completed an art foundation course at Harrow School of Art, before studying drama at the University of Birmingham.\nIn the early 1980s, Le Bon was engaged to his then longtime girlfriend, model-turned-actress Claire Stansfield.

Before being rescued, Le Bon and other crew members were trapped under the boat, inside the hull, for forty minutes. All of them were rescued by the Royal Navy, using a search and rescue (SAR) helicopter from 771 Naval Air Squadron based near Helston. The rescue earned the Rescue Diver, POACMN L Slater, a George Medal. Despite the accident, Le Bon and Drum went on to participate in the 1985\u20131986 Whitbread Round the World Race, coming in third overall in elapsed time. Le Bon and his partners eventually sold Drum; the events surrounding Drum and the races were chronicled in a 1989 movie entitled Drum \u2013 The Journey of a Lifetime and the book One Watch at a Time written by Drum's skipper, Skip Novak.\nTwenty years after his accident, in 2005, Le Bon made public his desire to race again. During a touring break in August 2005, Le Bon again raced Drum in the Fastnet Race, borrowing the vessel from her current owner (the late Scottish multi car garage owner Sir Arnold Clark) to participate, and raising funds for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) charity. Le Bon had to leave the race unfinished, as light winds were slowing Drum (and the other competitors), and would have delayed the boat's arrival at Plymouth, interfering with Le Bon's obligation to perform in Japan.

In 1996, she received her Bachelors of Science in biochemistry and molecular biology.Hu then moved to the United States to work as a research technician for one year at the University of California, San Francisco. She then pursued her graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley. Under the mentorship of Corey S. Goodman, Hu explored the role of the plexin receptor and the Rho family GTPases in central nervous system development in Drosophila. Plexins are receptors involved in axon guidance, and Hu discovered a seven amino acid sequence in plexin, PlexB, which is necessary for Rac-GTP binding and subsequently axon guidance. Interestingly, PlexB inhibits Rac from binding downstream interactors while at the same time enhancing RhoA activity, altogether driving axon guidance. In further work, Hu found that CrossGAP, a GTPase-activating protein, is responsible for regulating Rac dependent-cytoskeletal changes during axon guidance in Drosophila. Hu completed her PhD in 2002.Following her PhD, Hu pursued her postdoctoral work under the mentorship of Julius Zhu and Roberto Malinow at the University of Virginia. In 2004, Hu moved to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and then to the University of California, San Diego in 2006, to continue working under the mentorship of Malinow. During her postdoc, Hu explored the role of AMPA receptor trafficking in emotional enhancement of memory formation as well as the role of Ras GTPase signalling in fragile X syndrome.\nIn 2008, Hu returned to China and joined the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai and became the principal investigator of the Hu Lab. Her lab has been focusing on the neural mechanisms of social dominance in mice as well as the neural mechanisms of depression and the antidepressant effects of ketamine.

        "early_life": "Vecchioni was born in Carate Brianza, Province of Monza and Brianza, to a Neapolitan family. In 1968 he graduated in Classical Literature at the Catholic University of Milan, where he subsequently worked for two years as assistant lecturer of History of Religion. Later he was appointed professor of literature and history at a Milanese High School, an activity that he continued for almost thirty years and that would influence several of his songs.\nHis career in the Italian music industry began in the late 1960s as songwriter for Italian pop stars such as Ornella Vanoni, Gigliola Cinquetti, Mina, Iva Zanicchi and the band Nuovi Angeli. Vecchioni's first solo album, Parabola was released in 1971. In 1973 he took part in the Sanremo Festival with \"L'uomo che si gioca il cielo a dadi\". His 1974 LP,  Il re non si diverte, won the Best Year's Album Award from the Italian music critic. In 1976 he released Elisir. Vecchioni's breakthrough happened in 1977 with Samarcanda, an album where he drew inspiration mostly from autobiographical themes, intermingled with dreamy, literary, historical and mythological references. Angelo Branduardi played violin on the LP.\nVecchioni's skills were confirmed in the following works, Calabuig, Stranamore e altri incidenti (1978), where the literary citations predominated, and in Robinson (1979), where instead the autobiographical inspiration prevails. The songs \"Signor giudice\" and \"Lettera da Marsala\" of the latter work deal with the problems Vecchioni had had in the preceding years: respectively, a charge for marijuana possession (from which he was acquitted) and a dispute with his former record label. The following album, Montecristo, was released indeed by both the old and the new labels.\nAfter Hollywood Hollywood of 1982, whose songs are influenced by the world of cinema, Vecchioni in 1984 released the double LP Il grande sogno (\"The Great Dream\"), in which he collected new songs together with new versions of his past hits. The title track featured Francesco De Gregori playing blues harp. The LP was accompanied by his first literary attempt, a short book with the same name. Many of the cover of Vecchioni's LPs of this period were created by the famous Italian comic book artist and painter Andrea Pazienza.\nWhile continuing a successful career as a renowned singer-songwriter in the 1980s and the 1990s, Vecchioni spent more time writing. His prose includes the collection Viaggi nel tempo immobile (1996) and the novels Le parole non-portano le cicogne (2000) and Il libraio di Selinunte. He also lectured on the History of Italian Songwriting in a tour lasting two years, and was called to author the Enciclopedia Treccani article about Italian singer-songwriters. His best more recent works include Sogna ragazzo sogna (\"Dream, boy, dream\") of 1999 and Il lanciatore di coltelli (\"The Knife Thrower\") of 2002.\nOn 19 February 2011, he won the 61st Sanremo Music Festival and the \"Mia Martini\" Critics' Award with the song \"Chiamami ancora amore\" (\"Call me Love again\").\n",

Over time, he began to lose interest in reviewing Dutch literature. He said, \"My frustration with the quality of the Dutch literature increased more and more. My pieces were increasingly acidic and cynical.\" He responded to an advertisement for an editorship at De Haan and started work there in 1977.

Later on, she married Kuwaiti businessman Najeeb Al-Mutawa, and a man who was 15 years younger than her.In 1996, she was accused of \"adultery\" when she was engaged to Egyptian footballer Gamal Abdel-Hamid in Egypt, thus she was sentenced for three years in prison and to be banned from entering Egypt afterwards. She later accused Tunisian singer Latifa, and Egyptian lawyer Mortada Mansour, of being behind that false accusation. In 2011, she tried to enter Egypt but she was denied entry.\n",

He began playing guitar at an early age, and was surrounded by talented young musicians during his family's frequent visits to R\u0101tana P\u0101, who helped fulfill his lust for improving his skills on his instrument. He played gigs for friends and family during his high school years, and once he had finished school, he set to build his own band. \nThe result of this was The Sinners with Ted Cash on drums, Sonny Ratana on bass, Harold Hine on rhythm guitar and lead vocalist Theo Swanson. The band played at 21st birthday parties and the like until being invited to play at Rickies nightclub in Palmerston North and other venues around the Manawatu. The Sinners were one of the first New Zealand bands to utilise distortion and similar guitar effects, and these effects would become a staple of Billy's guitar sound.\nIt was around this time, in the mid-1960s, that Billy TK's friend, Ara Mete, gave Billy a gift \u2014 his first fuzz box and treble booster. Billy quickly took it to an electrical shop in Palmerston North, where he had copies of both made. Billy was hooked on the sound, and his obsession for guitar effects only received more grounding once the Jimi Hendrix album Are You Experienced? hit the airwaves in New Zealand, and Billy quickly made The Sinners learn all the tracks on the album.\nBilly TK is the father of Billy Te Kahika Jr., also a guitarist, who in June 2020 founded the New Zealand Public Party and Mara Te Kahika.\n",

He played as a defender, primarily in the role of an attacking full-back or winger on the left flank, although he was also capable of playing in several other positions both in defence and in midfield. He represented the Italy national team at UEFA Euro 1988 and the 1990 FIFA World Cup.",
        "early_life": "De Agostini was born in Udine. His professional career began with his hometown club, Udinese, making his debut in a 0\u20130 draw against Napoli on 23 March 1980. He was rarely played during his time at the club, forcing him to move to Serie C1 for Trento for a year. He was immediately back in the Serie A next year, however this time for Catanzaro before he moved back to Udinese, this time much more prominent. In 1986, he was signed on for Hellas Verona, though it would only be the following year that he would achieve his greatest success, signing with Juventus in 1987.During his five-year stay with Juventus, as well as taking on his usual defensive role, he was also often employed as a box-to-box midfielder, due to his offensive and defensive work-rate and contribution. Despite his defensive style of play, he was awarded the coveted number 10 shirt, following Michel Platini's retirement. With the club, he won both the Coppa Italia and the UEFA Cup during the 1989\u201390 season. He scored for Juventus as they beat rivals Fiorentina in the 1990 UEFA Cup Final. Despite being an accurate penalty taker, he is also remembered for missing a penalty against Fiorentina the following season, after Roberto Baggio had refused to take a penalty against his former club.

Italy subsequently went on to capture the bronze medal following a 2\u20131 victory over England in the third-place match. Under manager Azeglio Vicini, he was also often deployed as a wide midfielder or as a wing-back, in addition to his more regular full-back role. Unfortunately, his time with Juventus also included his last game for the Italian national team on 25 September 1991 in a 2\u20131 home loss to Bulgaria, during Italy's qualifying campaign for Euro 1992.

He is currently the chairman of the Taiwan People's Party since 2019.Before becoming mayor, he was a doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital. He was also a professor at National Taiwan University College of Medicine, and specialized in fields including trauma, intensive care, organ transplant, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and artificial organs. Due to his profession, he has been nicknamed Ko P or KP (which stands for Professor Ko, and is how he is customarily referred to within National Taiwan University). Ko was responsible for standardising organ transplant procedures in Taiwan, and was the first physician to bring ECMO to Taiwan. Apart from his practice, Ko is known for his numerous media appearances and interviews as a social and political commentator.\nIn the 2014 Taipei Mayoral Election, Ko ran as an independent candidate. He beat Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Pasuya Yao in the unofficial primary, gaining support from the DPP and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU). Ko won the election with 853,983 votes, becoming the first physician mayor of the city since the introduction of direct election to the office.",
        "early_life": "Ko Wen-je grew up in a modest household. His father, Ko Cheng-fa, had aspirations for Ko, as the eldest son, to become a medical doctor. His mother is Ho Jui-ying. After graduating from National Hsinchu Senior High School, Ko studied medicine for a year at National Yang-Ming University, before being accepted into the Medical School at NTU after resitting his university entrance exams.Between August 1986 and September 1988, Ko served in the 269th mechanized infantry division of the Republic of China Army to fulfill his military service obligation. He was a combat medic with the rank of second lieutenant.\nOn graduation, Ko placed first nationwide on the medical license exams and received his medical license. On the advice of his professor, Dr. Chu Shu-hsun, Ko decided to specialize in surgery and critical care within the department of Emergency Medicine, working on the front lines of the emergency room. After working in emergency services for 11 years, Ko traveled to the United States in 1993 for a one-year clinical fellowship program on artificial liver research at the University of Minnesota under Wei-Shou Hu.\nAfter returning to Taiwan in 1994, Ko continued to work in the emergency room while at the same time beginning his Ph.D. studies at NTU. With an invitation from Dr. Chu Shu-hsun, Ko helped found NTU's first organ transplant team, with the goal of performing heart transplants. Hoping to increase the transplant success rate, Ko introduced ECMO treatment from the US, and improved the transplant success rate from 19% to 51%. On 30 January 2008, Ko set a world record of 117 consecutive days for keeping a patient alive using ECMO. Using US treatment standards as a guide, Ko established a set of standards for organ transplant procedures in Taiwan that was later promulgated throughout Taiwan by the then Department of Health.\nIn 2002, Ko received his PhD degree in clinical medicine from NTU. Aside from his work improving medical technology in Taiwan, Ko has since the year 2000 participated in many foreign medical conferences in the People's Republic of China (PRC), where he was also responsible for introducing ECMO treatment to the nation.\nOn 15 July 2006, Ko wrote an article for the Min Sheng Daily titled \"Reflections, Errors, and Apologies: Chao Chien-ming\" that received considerable media attention and led to a number of politics-related interviews. On 18 November, Ko used ECMO to save the life of Shirley Shaw, wife of Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, who had fallen into a coma after a car accident. This incident in particular and the media attention it drew caused Ko Wen-je to become a household name.\nIn 2010, Ko introduced the American concept of integrated care to Taiwan, and established the Integrated Care Unit at NTU Hospital with the aim of reducing treatment cost and improving quality of treatment and quality of life for the attendant doctors and nurses. Ko directed the emergency care team that treated Sean Lien (Lien Sheng-wun) for critical wounds after he was shot in the face at close range with a 9mm pistol on 26 November. Lien recovered quickly, which led the media to speculate about the veracity of his story, but Ko quickly came forward to verify his claims.On 24 August 2011, Ko was held responsible for an organ transplant error and subsequently reprimanded by National Taiwan University Hospital and the Ministry of Health of Taiwan. He was the acting director for a standard organ transplant procedure in which 5 patients received transplants from a coma patient who was HIV-positive. In 2012, the Control Yuan accused Ko of misconduct for violating organ transplant procedures.\nIn May 2013, the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice suspected Ko of involvement in the misappropriation of National Science Council funds by creating fraudulent receipts, and asked Ko for an itemized list of payment details. Ko was thus drawn into the Accounting Act Amendment scandal, but the Control Yuan never brought charges. In June that year, Ko's emergency trauma care student Dr. Tseng Yue-tsee was hit by a drunk driver and sustained major trauma. She was brought to the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital. Ko went to the hospital as soon as he was notified and oversaw her treatment, but she died. As a result of this incident, Ko started a foundation for the prevention of drunk driving. In August, Ko was invited by Control Yuan member Huang Huang-hsiung to attend a conference in Beijing and to visit Yan'an, Shaanxi Province. Ko became more focused on politics and announced his candidacy for Taipei City Mayor on 6 January 2014.\nKo's wife, Chen Pei-chi, was born in Penghu, Taiwan. She graduated from Makung Senior High School and National Taiwan University's Department of Medicine. She is the director of Pediatrics for Taipei City Hospital, Heping Fuyou Women and Children's Health Branch. Ko and Chen had an arranged marriage, and have three children, one boy and two girls. It is known throughout Taiwan that as a mayor Ko earns less than his wife. He once joked that in order to pay off their home mortgage, his wife still could not retire early. Ko has claimed to have Asperger syndrome, but, as of 2014, had not been diagnosed. His son also has the condition.\n",

He was one of thirteen children largely raised by his devoutly Christian paternal grandmother, Emma Klonjlaleh Brown after his parents separated when George was still a baby. He attended middle school at Muslim Congress and high school at Wells Hairston High School, and reportedly dropped out in his final year of studies. He began to play football for the Young Survivors youth club at the age of 15 and later moved to other local football clubs, assuming starring roles for Mighty Barrolle and Invicible Eleven. Before his football career allowed him to move abroad, Weah worked for the Liberia Telecommunications Corporation as a switchboard technician.\nAfter playing in the Liberian domestic league at the beginning of his successful career and winning several national honors (including the Liberian Premier League and the Liberian Cup), Weah's abilities were discovered by the Cameroon national team coach, Claude Le Roy, who relayed the news to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.

Representing one of the smaller nations in world football and perennial underdogs, Weah did much to support the national squad: aside from being the team's star player, he also later coached the squad and even funded his national side to a large extent. Despite his efforts, he was unsuccessful in helping Liberia qualify for a single FIFA World Cup, falling just a point short in qualifying for the 2002 tournament. However, he did help Liberia to qualify for the African Cup of Nations on two occasions: Weah represented his country in the 1996 and 2002 editions of the tournament, although Liberia failed to make it out of their group both times, suffering first-round eliminations.Weah has been named by several media outlets as one of the best players to never play at the World Cup.\nOne of the greatest African players of all time, George Weah was, like his namesake George Best before him, hamstrung in World Cup terms by hailing from a global minnow.\nWeah returned to the national team for a specially arranged friendly against Nigeria on 11 September 2018, his final international appearance, playing at the age of 51 while in office as the country's president. His number 14 shirt, worn at his playing peak, was retired after the friendly, with Weah receiving a standing ovation when he was substituted.\nWeah has four children; three children with his Jamaican-born wife Clar Weah: George, Tita, and Timothy and a child from another relationship. In 2016, he was sued by the mother of his daughter for child support expenses.\nBoth of his sons became footballers and signed for Paris Saint-Germain, although only Timothy played for the first team. Both played youth internationals for the United States, and Timothy was capped for the senior team.Weah practiced Islam for ten years before converting back to Christianity. Currently, Weah again practices Protestantism. In October 2017, he was spotted in the prominent Nigerian church of Pastor T.B. Joshua alongside Liberian Senator Prince Yormie Johnson. Joshua was allegedly a key influence in Johnson's decision to endorse Weah's candidacy in the 2017 Liberian elections.He holds French citizenship and speaks the French language fluently.\n",
        "gpt_completion": "Based on the input, George Weah's decision to become a footballer was influenced by his upbringing in a poor area of Liberia, his early introduction to football through local clubs, his success in Liberian domestic football, and the opportunities that arose when his talents were discovered by Claude Le Roy and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Additionally, his achievements and recognition in European football, including winning the African Footballer of the Year award twice, further solidified his career as a footballer."

        "early_life": "Jo Jeong-rae was born in Suncheon, Jeollanam-do, in 1943 in the Sonamsa Temple. When the Korean War broke out, Jo Jeong-rae and his family evacuated to the South, where he was unpopular with the local children and frequently fought with them, fights he generally lost. He was interested in literature from early in life, and won competitions in elementary school. He majored in Korean literature at Dongguk University, and worked as a high school teacher for several years after graduation. His literary debut was in 1970 when he published the short story \"A False Charge\" (\ub204\uba85), after which he decided to devote his entire life to literature.\nJo Jeong-rae's popular multi-volume novels Taebaek Mountain Range (\ud0dc\ubc31\uc0b0\ub9e5, 1983-1989) and Arirang (\uc544\ub9ac\ub791, 1995), both of which have come to be considered modern classics since their publication in the 1980s, are widely considered to be the epitome of his talent. With the publication of his novel Han River (\ud55c\uac15, 2002), Jo Jeong-rae finally completed his trilogy of works dedicated to modern Korean history. Sales of the series reached record-breaking numbers in South Korea, selling over 10 million copies.The epic historical trilogy, begun in 1983 and eventually completed in 2002, comprises Jo Jeong-rae's three most well-known novels: Taebaek Mountain Range, Arirang, and Han River. Each novel is over ten volumes in length, and each deals with different aspects of the turbulent history of Korea in the modern era. The first novel, Taebaek Mountain Range, examines the five-year period between the liberation of Korea from Japanese colonial rule in 1945 to the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, with detailed flashbacks and backstory contextualizing the deep ideological conflict that culminated in violence and the division of Korea. The second novel, Arirang, is technically a prequel to Taebaek Mountain Range, and covers the Japanese colonial period of Korean history.One of the primary themes in Jo Jeong-rae's work, concern regarding the socio-economic roots of the division of Korea and the search for Korean reunification, is also present in his other, shorter works of fiction, particularly his later works, such as \"Sorrow, That Shaded Place\" (\ud55c \uadf8 \uadf8\ub298\uc758 \uc790\ub9ac), \"Land of Exile\" (\uc720\ud615\uc758 \ub545), \"Human Stairs\" (\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uacc4\ub2e8), and \"The Soul of a Barren Land\" (\ubc15\ud1a0\uc758 \ud63c). Many of his earlier works, however, such as \"A Woman from Cheongsan\" (\uccad\uc0b0\ub301), \"The Violent Instructor\" (\ud401\ub140\uc11d \uad50\uc0ac), \"The Shaded Slope\" (\ube44\ud0c8\uc9c4 \uc74c\uc9c0), \"The Age of Geocentrism\" (\ucc9c\ub3d9\uc124 \uc2dc\ub300), and \"Foreign Land\" (\uc774\ubc29\uc9c0\ub300), tend to reconstruct stories of traditional rustic life, targeting and satirizing the various absurdities of life in a much more general fashion.\n",

The success and recognition of his popular novels, such as Taebaek Mountain Range and Arirang, further solidified his dedication to a career in literature. Additionally, Jo Jeong-rae's exploration of themes related to Korean history, division, and reunification in his works played a significant role in shaping his decision to devote his entire life to writing."

        "early_life": "Claire Cottrill was born in Atlanta, Georgia, and raised in Carlisle, Massachusetts. She is the daughter of marketing executive Geoff Cottrill and Allie Cottrill, a photographer and designer.\nCottrill began recording covers at the age of 13; she often performed covers at local businesses including Blue Dry Goods. During this time, MTV contacted her to record a song to be used as background music for one of their shows, but the song was never used. She began posting music to Bandcamp under the names Clairo and DJ Baby Benz while attending Concord-Carlisle High School. She went on to post covers and songs in addition to DJ mixes of rap music on SoundCloud. She also posted three short films on an old YouTube channel, and maintained a second one where she would post covers in addition to short films.\nShe launched her EP Do U Wanna Fall in Love? in 2013 after releasing several home recordings. A few additional EPs, including Aquarius Boy, Late Show, Moth Girl, Metal Heart, and Have a Nice Day, came after this in 2015. \nClairo first drew wide attention in late 2017 when the video for her song \"Pretty Girl\" went viral on YouTube. The song was recorded for an indie rock compilation benefiting the Transgender Law Center. According to her, she recorded the track \"using the resources around me which were pretty shitty. I used like a little keyboard that I had and I was really into '80s pop music \u2014 my mom is obsessed with it \u2014 so it kind of inspired me to do something like that.\" She has attributed audience interest in the video to YouTube's algorithm system. The video also became popular on vaporwave-centric Facebook groups. \"Pretty Girl\" had amassed more than 81 million views on YouTube by 2022. A piece written by Joe Coscarelli of The New York Times said that the work: \"bridges both worlds, building on the coy, understated bedroom pop of 'Pretty Girl' and 'Flaming Hot Cheetos' toward sturdier numbers like '4EVER' and 'B.O.M.D.'\".Another video, \"Flaming Hot Cheetos\", was released a month before \"Pretty Girl\" on YouTube. It garnered 3 million views by July 2018. The success of \"Pretty Girl\" led to interest from major labels such as Capitol, RCA, and Columbia. Jon Cohen, the co-founder of The Fader, signed Clairo to the magazine's associated record label with a 12-song record contract and introduced her to Pat Corcoran, manager of Chance the Rapper. She became a client of talent agency Haight Brand near the end of 2017. After the success of \"Pretty Girl\", a number of social media users (specifically on discussion website Reddit) began claiming that Clairo was an \"industry plant\" who gained success through her father's nepotism. She denied the claims, calling them sexist. Writers for The Guardian and The Ringer also stated that her father's connections facilitated her record contract signing. In 2021 she spoke openly about the accusations, telling Rolling Stone, \"I definitely am not blind to the fact that things have been easier for me than other people's experiences. It would be stupid of me to not acknowledge the privilege I had from the start to be able to sign somewhere where there's trust, to be able to sign a record deal that doesn't revolve around keeping myself afloat financially.\"\nIn the early days of her career, Cottrill was once in a relationship with Jake Passmore, who is a member of the London-based band SCORS.In 2017, Cottrill began attending Syracuse University, studying in the Bandier Program for Recording and Entertainment Industries, but dropped out after one year to pursue music full time. Cottrill was diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis at the age of 17. Cottrill came out as bisexual to her fans via Twitter in May 2018. In an interview, she explained that making friends in college is what helped her to come out as they were openly gay and she was inspired by \"their confidence and their willingness to be exposed.\" In July 2020, she signed an open letter to then-UK Equalities minister Liz Truss calling for a ban on all forms of LGBT+ conversion therapy.\n",

He established himself in their starting line-up, and there was even talk of a call-up to the Italy national team. Disaster struck, however, when a tackle by Brighton and Hove Albion's Paul Clark shattered his leg. He broke his leg for a second time during his comeback match for the Luton youth team. He did manage, eventually, to regain his place in the team and played an important part as they won Second Division in 1982.In 1983 Fuccillo left Luton following a contractual dispute and played 19 games for the Tulsa Roughnecks in the North American Soccer League.Fuccillo then joined Southend United, before John Wile brought him to Peterborough United.

He joined Barry Fry at Birmingham City as coach, and then moved back to Peterborough United to be his assistant. His third spell at Peterborough United did not last long, however, as Fry sacked both Fuccillo and coach Mick Halsall in December 1996 as an economy measure.\nFuccillo had spells as a scout for Sheffield Wednesday and as John Still's right-hand man at Barnet, but in November 2000 he returned to Luton Town as a scout. A week later he was promoted to assistant manager, but, with the club at the foot of the league, Ricky Hill was sacked within weeks so Fuccillo then stepped up into the managerial seat. Following an unsuccessful reign, Joe Kinnear was brought to the club in February as Director of Football, but took it upon himself to replace Fuccillo as manager as well. Surprisingly, Fuccillo remained at Luton Town as a coach until the end of the season. Their third manager of the season, however, was unable to save the club and Luton were relegated to the basement division for the first time since 1968.\nDuring the summer of 2001 he joined United Counties League side Wootton Blue Cross as a coach for John Taylor, making an immediate impact with the team starting with a ten-match winning sequence. After a season Fuccillo linked up with Peterborough United for a fourth time as a scout, but again this spell did not last long as he moved to perform a similar role with Premiership side Everton, combined at the start with some part-time coaching at Taylor's new club St Neots Town. He was reunited once more with Taylor as he began the 2006\u201307 season as a coach at Isthmian League side Arlesey Town, but in November 2006 joined Leicester City as chief scout.On 21 March 2008, Lil Fucillo was appointed chief scout for Newcastle United.

        "summary": "HK119 is the alter ego of Finnish multimedia artist, singer and recording artist Heidi Kilpel\u00e4inen, who lives and works in London, England.",
        "early_life": "Having graduated from Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in 2004 with an MA in Fine Art from combining her skills as a performance artist with stage design, video production and her budding music production, Kilpel\u00e4inen felt that the output of this mix of performance art and multimedia was best delivered through the fictitious character of HK119; a character born out of science fiction references and a fictitious barcode number.\nThe character of HK119 was a tongue-in-cheek critique at mass consumerism, and Kilpel\u00e4inen's theories regarding humanity's relationship with everything from socialism and capitalism, to technology and celebrity culture, all delivered in an underlying humorous tone.Kilpel\u00e4inen's lo-fi, do-it-yourself approach to recording music (initially alone, on a digital 8-track (multitrack) recorder) and recording her own music videos dressed in everyday materials (such as tin foil and paper) for each track, provided Kilpel\u00e4inen with enough material to form the basis of her live stage shows, for which her videos would frequently provide a backdrop, while she sang over a backing track of her songs.  HK119's live performances quickly gained her comparisons to artists such as David Bowie, Grace Jones and Nina Hagen due to Kilpel\u00e4inen's signature style of black catsuits, robotic dancing, giant cardboard headpieces and inflated black refuse bags.\nIn 2004, her videos and performances around the London club scene caught the attention of Leila Arab, an Electronic musician signed to the influential Warp Records label.  Leila passed Kilpel\u00e4inen's work on to Icelandic musician Bj\u00f6rk, who announced HK119 as her favourite act of 2004 in Q Magazine, calling HK119 \"The Perfect Blonde Woman\".HK119 was signed to Bj\u00f6rk's parent label, One Little Indian Records, which released HK119's first single \"Pick Me Up\" in November 2005, followed by her eponymous debut album in February 2006.  The HK119 album was a collection of the songs Kilpel\u00e4inen had produced as part of her degree, and was notable for its considerably lo-fi, electro sound.\nIn 2008, HK119 returned with her second album, Fast, Cheap and Out of Control.  HK119's style\u2014visually and musically\u2014changed considerably as a result of Kilpel\u00e4inen's first collaboration with other producers. Sheffield based electronic dance producers I Monster were the main production force behind 'Fast, Cheap And Out of Control', bringing a glossier, smoother, and more-melodic style to Kilpel\u00e4inen's lyrics.  She adopted a sports-themed attire for her visuals and live performances.\nAround the time of Fast, Cheap and Out of Control release, HK119 and One Little Indian Records made each track on the album available in individual parts online as part of a remix challenge.  Anyone's remixed single submitted to the label would be considered for a remixed version of the album. Bit-Phalanx, a London netlabel and music-manager specialising in electronic music, commissioned its entire roster of artists to remix one of HK119's tracks each and compiled an entire remix album, Fast And Cheap Mixes, which One Little Indian Records released as a digital download in early 2010.Bit-Phalanx released also two free bonus EPs of remixes of \"C'est La Vie\" and \"Space Pt.1\" exclusively on the label's website. The former track was the lead single from Fast, Cheap and Out of Control.\nFrom early 2012, HK119 was preparing for her third solo album and performing infrequent live shows. A song titled \"Adailson\" was available for free download from One Little Indian's SoundCloud on 6 November 2012. She released her third studio album Imaginature on 23 March 2013. The song \"Snowblind\" was picked as the first single. The album was produced by Christoffer Berg.\n",

Their lo-fi, DIY approach to recording music and creating music videos, as well as their unique live performances, gained them recognition and comparisons to other iconic artists, leading to a record deal and the release of their debut album and subsequent projects."

Although she considers this her best work of fiction, and although she had an excellent track record in the publishing business, she was obliged to self-publish it for lack of interest by commercial publishers.Fabend's curiosity about the Dutch colonial period in New York and New Jersey was sparked at first by her learning that her father's family had been instrumental in the settling of Rockland and Bergen counties, beginning in the 1680s.Felicitously, her interest coincided with and was mightily reinforced by the New Netherland Project, a major translation effort undertaken beginning in 1974 by Dr. Charles T. Gehring in Albany, NY, under the aegis of the State of New York. Gehring's translations and retranslations of the Dutch colonial records and documents, which have been steadily published over the decades since the 1970s, gave rise to a renaissance in the historiography of the Dutch period of New York and New Jersey from which she has benefited not only in substance but in many warm friendships with her colleagues in Dutchness. In 2017, she received the Alice P. Kenney Award from the New Netherland Institute for her contributions to scholarship related to the Dutch colony in North America.\nShe is a participant in the New York Council for the Humanities Speakers Program as well as its Community Conversations, and she has over the years consulted for the Museum of the City of New York, the American History Workshop, the New Amsterdam History Center, the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, the Hudson River Museum, the New York State Historical Association, and other institutions concerned with American history. She was elected the first President of the Jacob Leisler Institute for the Study of Early New York History, located in Hudson, NY, in 2014.\nIn the 1970s, she was invited to deposit her papers in The Twentieth Century Archives, in what is today called The Howard Gotlieb Archival Center, in the Mugar Memorial Library, Boston University. The Firth Haring Collection contains copies of all her works, including a memoir she self-published in 2008, Only a Paper Life, her book contracts for her first five novels, her manuscripts of these novels, and the correspondence and reviews relating to them. (Of Only a Paper Life, Cambridge University English professor Richard Gooder of Clare College wrote, \u201cIt remains a little masterpiece. I know nothing else like it.\u201d); personal correspondence, July 22, 2009.\nHer genealogical notes and other material on the Haring family are in Special Collections and University Archives in the Alexander Library, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, and also in the manuscript collection of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society. She is married to E. Carl Fabend, lives in Verona, New Jersey, and has two daughters, three grandchildren, and two step-grandchildren.\n",
        "gpt_completion": "The person's decision to become a historian was influenced by their dissatisfaction with developments in the publishing world, leading them to give up fiction writing and pursue academia instead. They obtained a doctorate in American Studies and focused their research on the Dutch colonial period of New York and New Jersey. Their interest in this field was further ignited by the New Netherland Project and the translations of Dutch colonial records, resulting in a renaissance in the historiography of that period."

        "early_life": "Gu was born 4 February 1930 in Suzhou, Jiangsu, Republic of China. He is the youngest son of Gu Tinglong (\u987e\u5ef7\u9f99), a well known sinologist and calligrapher. His given name \"Songfen\" comes from a passage  of the 3rd-century treatise Wen fu written by Lu Ji.In 1935, Gu Tinglong accepted a job at the Yenching University library, and moved the family to Beijing. Two years later, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out and Japanese warplanes bombed the Xiyuan Barracks of the Chinese 29th Army on 28 July 1937. As the Gu family lived near the barracks, their house was shaken by the explosions. Songfen recalled watching the bombs fall out of the planes, before adults urged him to hide under the dining table. He attributes this experience as the main reason he decided to become an aircraft designer.To escape Japanese occupation, in 1938 Gu Tinglong moved the family to the Shanghai French Concession, where he helped establish the United Library (\u5408\u4f17\u56fe\u4e66\u9986). After the end of the war, Songfen graduated from high school in 1947 and entered National Chiao Tung University, Shanghai to study aeronautical engineering.\nGu graduated from university in 1951, and was assigned to work for the newly established Aviation Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, under China's top aircraft designers Xu Shunshou and Huang Zhiqian. The People's Republic of China (PRC), which had just been founded two years earlier, was still establishing its aviation industry, and in the early years Gu mostly worked on servicing Soviet-made aircraft.In August 1956, the Aviation Industry Bureau established the PRC's first airplane design office in Shenyang, with Xu Shunshou as its director, Huang Zhiqian and Ye Zhengda as deputy directors. Gu, then 26 years old, was appointed head of the aerodynamics group. The office's first task was to design and build a jet trainer, the Shenyang JJ-1. The plane took its first flight on 26 July 1958, which marked a new era of China's aviation industry.\nGu was transferred to Beijing in 1986 to serve as Deputy Director of the national government's Aviation Industry and Technology Commission. In this capacity, he participated in planning the future development of China's aviation industry. In June 2001, Gu, Wang Daheng, Shi Changxu and more than a dozen other scientists proposed the development of China's own jetliner. The proposal was adopted by the Chinese government in 2007, and the Comac C919 took its maiden flight ten years later, on 5 May 2017.Gu was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1991, and of the Chinese Academy of Engineering in 1994. He won the 1995 Ho Leung Ho Lee Prize for Science and Technology Progress. He was elected a delegate to the 7th, 8th, and 9th National People's Congress, and was a member of the Standing Committee of the 9th National People's Congress.\n\n\n== References ==\n",

What remains is \"a photo of a painting of a person, and the real person hidden somewhere underneath.\" She takes a classical concept \u2013 trompe-l'\u0153il, the art of making a two-dimensional representational painting look like a real three-dimensional space \u2013 and does the opposite, making real life appear to be a painting.",
        "early_life": "Meade was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Chevy Chase, Maryland. She graduated from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, in 2009, with a bachelor's degree in political science. Initially planning on a path in politics, she interned for congressmen and senators on Capitol Hill, and then worked as a press assistant on Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.\nIn 2009, an assignment in an elective art class at Vassar College sparked Meade's curiosity. She decided to explore space and light through the idea of putting black paint on the ground where the shadows were cast. She later expanded the concept by making a grayscale \"mapping of light\" with paint on the human body. In so doing, she realized that she had made the three-dimensional form appear to be a two-dimensional painting.\nThe results of these experiments changed her perspective and inspired her to reevaluate her career goals. Despite having grown up surrounded by the political culture of Washington D.C. and initially planning to enter that field herself, as Meade says, \u201cI just felt like even though this was supposed to be my dream, it didn\u2019t quite fit with who I thought I was on the inside.\u201dAfter graduation, she honed her technique in her parents\u2019 Washington, D.C. basement by\npracticing painting on inanimate objects including grapefruits, fried eggs and sausage. She has credited her lack of formal art training with allowing her to come up with unique ideas of surfaces she could paint on, since she didn't think of painting as something that necessarily had\nto be done on a canvas.Meade first gained public recognition in March 2010, when her living paintings went viral following a short post about her work on Jason Kottke's blog kottke.org. She soon received coverage on CNN and elsewhere. Her website went from having negligible views to an estimated 30,000-page views the next day. Her most famous artwork at the time, \"Transit,\" features an older man Meade painted on in her basement studio, and then photographed riding the Washington, D.C. metro, looking \"as if a painting from the National Portrait Gallery has leapt off its wall to go walking through the flesh-and-blood world. Her speech at the 2013 TEDGlobal conference in Edinburgh, Scotland, \"Your Body is my Canvas,\" offers a behind the scenes look at her work, and details her career beginnings. She has named installation artist Robert Irwin as an inspiration, citing his biography, Seeing is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees, as an influence on how she thinks about the perception of space.\n",

However, one day the class had moved to somewhere else, so he ended up quitting. \nHe was engaged in drawing pictures after for a while when he was 14 years old, and one day he found a little electric guitar which was given as a present by his dad a long time ago behind a chest and he then started playing it. At that time, his parents led him to listen to pops and hard rock music from the 60s to 80s. On the other hand, he preferred to listen to alternative rock and electronica / ambient and tried to play those songs everyday by copying them simply by watching them.\nHis guitar technique was almost completed by the time he entered high school. The audio sources which he created at that time are available to listen to on his public website or his first independent album. He talked about why he started focusing on acoustic guitar ? which he now plays \u2013 at that time. The reason was because the electric guitar's circuit always broke down and he got sick of fixing it. As a result, he found something new about the possibility of the way of expression with the acoustic guitar which was different from the electric guitar, and he really started songwriting focusing on this.\nHe revealed that he was suffering from a mental illness on his website, because of the violence he received several times from his dad when he was a child. So he announced \"A person in the water\", in which he expressed the side effects of the sleeping pills and tranquilizer medication by using the music and movies. However, he says that his relationship with his dad has been good lately.\nSince 2005, he made another artists name by putting his real name's initials and an English word which means'cacophony' together and converted it to a coined word. So then he started releasing many of his musical compositions which he'd saved up by that time on the Internet.\nIn 2006, he released his independent albums, which are 'Experimental Album' and 'Stubborn Ears Forbidden', and 'How to get much more' the following year. \nIn 2008, he debuted by releasing his album 'Sharing the emotion', which was released for the first time in Japan.He told about the reason why he liked focusing on releasing his music works as below. \n\"I've been controlling my mental illness well by listening to my own music for reminding myself of various memories. I can transform the present to some different time and place from where I am now. When I listen to my music, I can be in a different place. Because all the musical works were written only for me, I didn't mean to release them to the public. But I realized that if I released the albums, my music would remain in the world forever and I can share my emotion with a lot of people in the world. Now I feel it is quite stimulating. I found that benefit isn't always about money. \"\nIn 2011, he did music session with the first drummer of Saosin \"Pat Magrath\" on the internet. And there is the video on their channel of YouTube. \nOn 21 November, he appeared on the Japanese famous TV show \"\u884c\u5217\u306e\u3067\u304d\u308b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u76f8\u8ac7\u6240\".

She says that the subject of cinema combined all her interests, in \"writing, photography, music... together in one art form\".\nIn 2003, Qu returned to Beijing, in order to become a film producer, and to pursue her interest in helping independent filmmakers. She says that she became aware that whilst filmmakers in China have good ideas and scripts, they lack the resources to produce or market their films for an international audience. In 2007, she began producing films in collaboration with Chinese film director  Diao Yi'Nan, and first produced Night Train, the story of a young, widowed prison guard who takes a night train to a dating service, as she feels lonely and isolated. The film was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. The following year, she produced the film Knitting, a romantic drama told from a female perspective and based on the Chinese myth of the cowherd and the weaver girl, as told in the Qixi Festival. In 2013, she produced Longing for the Rain, the story of a woman living in a loveless marriage until a man appears in her dreams, and with whom she finds she cannot live without.As Qu was working creatively with film directors in her role as film producer, she also decided to try to direct. Her debut feature as director, Trap Street, made in 2013, tells the story of a young digital map-maker who finds his computerised maps have been mysteriously altered after he becomes infatuated with a young woman working for China's intelligence service, in a street which does not officially exist. Qu says that the film reflects a changing reality in modern China, in which people have started to notice \"little things that are happening\", such as \"the Internet and text messages being censored all the time\", with social media services such as Facebook routinely inaccessible. She also says that people are detained by the authorities for apparently minor infractions, such as keying in particular words on search engines. However, she says that, despite such perceptions, for most of the younger generation in China, who did not live through such periods as the Cultural Revolution, \"this is something completely new\", and that they don't understand why it is happening. She says that, for her, \"this [trend] is very disturbing... but we're not taking it seriously\".\n",

Their awareness of the changing realities and censorship in modern China, as well as the lack of understanding and seriousness towards it by the younger generation, further motivated them to use film as a medium to shed light on these issues."

Vogel has shown that both processes, the generation of RNA and the arrangement of RNA into proteins, are important. She demonstrated that the process of generating RNA from DNA is pulsed-like: brief spikes of activity that relax to a ground state, whereas the creation of proteins was more like an on-off switch.Vogel is interested in how genes respond to different stressors and how certain environmental conditions can give rise to mutations such as cancer. Amongst these genes, Vogel has studied BRCA1, which, if functioning properly, can prevent cells from dividing or growing. Mutations on the BRCA1 means that damage to DNA cannot be repaired, such that cells mutate and cause cancer.

The family moved from Manchester to Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, when he was an infant. He attended Woking Grammar School followed by a sixth-form college. Later, Read worked as an estate agent, and recorded under various names, including Mickey Manchester.\nRead's professional broadcasting career began in March 1976 at Reading's Radio 210, where he co-hosted a slot with Steve Wright \u2013 entitled Read and Wright \u2013 before joining Radio Luxembourg late in 1977. Read joined Radio 1 in November 1978 and was soon presenting the night-time programme before the slot fronted by John Peel; here, Read championed new groups and featured live sessions. On 5 January 1981, he took over Radio 1 Breakfast.\nOn 11 January 1984, Read suddenly interrupted broadcasting the Frankie Goes to Hollywood song \"Relax\", halfway through playing the single, denouncing the lyrics as 'obscene'. Read has said this account of his intervention is a myth; the interruption of the record was solely for timing reasons, as he only had access in the studio to the longer 12\" version. The BBC had already decided to ban the record from Top of the Pops, even though it subsequently reached No. 1 in the UK singles chart.Following on from his five-year stint on Radio 1's breakfast slot, Read took over a Sunday morning programme in 1986. A year later, he moved to Saturday mornings, and also to a Sunday afternoon series, where he played classic tracks. In addition, he hosted Round Table and later went back to it as the renamed Singled Out on Friday evenings, in which musicians and disc jockeys would review new single releases.\nRead's Saturday morning slot ended in September 1988, and his Sunday afternoon oldies series finished in January 1989, when Alan Freeman re-joined the station to host an oldies version of Pick of the Pops, which Read covered in November that year when Freeman was ill. From January 1989 to September 1990, Read presented a weekly series, The Mike Read Collection, (which was broadcast on Monday evenings) and remained on the Friday panel show Singled Out (which by then had gone back to its original name of Round Table); he remained in this slot until 1991.\n",

Shortly after the start of World War II, the family moved to Connecticut.\nFlagg began his career in radio as a \"singing cowboy\" calling himself The Lone Pine Cowboy. He then moved to bluegrass before he and his friend, John Sligar, changed to rockabilly in 1954. Flagg is the first musician known to use this term. The musical style as such had already existed and had been played by musicians such as Hardrock Gunter and Roy Hall. Because of his rising popularity on the radio, he got a recording contract with Tetra Records in New York City. With his band members, Cat Gibson and Ted Barton, henceforth calling themselves The Rockabillies, Flagg recorded his first record in 1956, Howie Stange. The first singles, including Go Cat Go and Guitar Rock, recorded with a contrabass and two acoustic guitars, did not show on the Billboard charts. The records were marketed as \"rockabillie\" by Tetra.\nIn 1958, Flagg changed to MGM Records and released his last single. After that, he worked in his family's business and helped his father, who had previously suffered a heart attack. He only appeared in bars on weekends. Twenty-seven years after his musical career, his son, Bob, persuaded him to actively join the music scene again. After that, Flagg started a bluegrass band called Hobo Bill and the Last Ride.

        "early_life": "His show business career started as a child actor in the CBS western television series, The Texan starring Rory Calhoun, and in the recurring role of a schoolboy on ABC's sitcom, The Donna Reed Show.  In addition to television appearances, he has acted in and produced such feature films as A Gun, A Car, A Blonde, starring Billy Bob Thornton and John Ritter, and Sin-Jin Smyth, starring Jonathan Davis, Richard Tyson, Don Stroud, and Roddy Piper.\nHis first record sessions included Ernie Freeman, and the then unknown Daryl Dragon, Charles Wright and Jimi Hendrix who was at the time working under the name Jimmy James.  Also unsigned at the time, was a band called Love consisting of Bryan MacLean (rhythm guitar), Johnny Echols (lead guitar), Ken Forssi (bass) and Don Conka (drums). Flaherty sat in with the group at L.A. clubs called The Brave New World and Bito Lido's, and the group minus their leader Arthur Lee, backed him up on several records. Meanwhile, Love attracted a huge following at Bito Lido's, and word of Vince's distinctive style of guitar and harmonica playing spread, enabling him to become booked on sessions with L.A. Rock and Blues artists, such as Etta James.\nIn later years, original members of Love mentioned that his arrangement of \"Yes It's True\", recorded three months earlier than Love's biggest hit \"7&7 Is\", was the band's inspiration to change Arthur Lee's previously slow folk song into a driving, rolling beat that reaches an explosive crescendo and then starts up slow again.\nSongwriter Sharon Sheeley, (\"Somethin Else\", \"Poor Little Fool\") was Vince's girlfriend at the time. She told her friends that he reminded her of her fianc\u00e9, rocker Eddie Cochran who was killed in a car crash in London. Sheeley took Flaherty to London for a try out with The Playboys, after their front man Vince Taylor overdosed on LSD. The audition didn't work out and The Playboys became The Bobbie Clarke Noise, named after their leader, who was the first known rock drummer to use a double bass. Later, Bobbie Clarke came to America and replaced Love's drummer Don Conka, on Flaherty's recordings with Love.\nAfterward, Flaherty took over the front man spot for a group called The Elves Themselves, and recorded a single called \"The Certificate\" that included Jimi Hendrix on guitar, Ken Forssi on bass and Bobbie Clarke on drums. Vince and The Elves also made a record entitled \"Feel Alright\" produced by Vic Diaz of the Matadors, purportedly for Lou Adler, the producer of Jan and Dean, and The Mamas & the Papas. More recordings might have been available, but Clarke soon garnered the distinction of becoming the first UK rocker to be busted for pot and swiftly deported.\nSubsequently, Flaherty was cast to star in a Western movie and departed for Italy. The movie was never completed. Instead, Flaherty was rendered unconscious, fed intravenously, and kept asleep for a period of nearly three months. The producers maintained the star had gone insane, and they collected a large sum from the completion bond company. Meanwhile, no one had heard anything from Flaherty. Sharon Sheeley found out where he was, and with the help of Gordon Waller, half of the singing duo Peter and Gordon, obtained custody papers from Gordon's father, a prominent London physician. Together Sharon and Gordon traveled to the Villa Belvedere outside of Rome where Flaherty was being held and obtained his release. The bizarre circumstance left Flaherty a wreck and he was not able to record or effectively pursue a career for several years.\nIn 1969, Jimi Hendrix had a surprise lineup change for the last day of the concert at Devonshire Downs, and he utilized Flaherty to deliver and set up the equipment of Buddy Miles. That date marked end of the Jimi Hendrix Experience and the advent of Jimi's new group with Buddy Miles and Billy Cox. No one including the Experience's Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell realized that Hendrix was changing his band because he was given to spontaneously jamming with so many different players.\nHe was a director of the Pacific Palisades Historical Society and was a member of the Pacific Palisades Community Council, credited with saving a 16-acre (65,000 m2) wooded area in the Palisades, known as The Ocean Woods, from a tract of 23 homes.  He still performs with his band The Invincebles at venues in the Los Angeles area.\n",

Additionally, personal relationships with individuals in the industry, such as songwriter Sharon Sheeley, and experiences such as being cast in a Western movie that was never completed may have further shaped their career path. Their continued involvement in the music industry, as evidenced by their performances with their band, also suggests a passion and commitment to their chosen field."

Ho joined a post-graduate programme at the University of Hong Kong in 1984 and obtained his mandatory practising qualification, the postgraduate certificate in laws (PCLL) in 1986.\nAfter gaining his qualifications he was admitted as a solicitor in Hong Kong in 1988 and similarly admitted in Singapore, and England and Wales in 1995 and 1997.

It was reported that the individual by the name of \"Junius Kwan-Yiu Ho\" does not appear to be on the SRA's records.  The dispute, however, was later clarified, for a member by the name of \"Kwan Yiu Ho\" does appear to be on SRA's records.\nHo first contested a Legislative Council election in 2008, running against Civic Party's Margaret Ng in the Legal functional constituency.

Students staged a protest against the appointment over fears of political interference in university governance.In the 2015 District Council elections, Junius Ho defeated Albert Ho of the Democratic Party in the latter's long-held Lok Tsui seat in a six-way contest by a narrow margin of 277 votes, as the pro-democracy votes were split between Albert Ho and Cheng Chung-tai of Civic Passion. Ho ran again in the 2016 Legislative Council election for the New Territories West.

        "summary": "Candy Lo is a Canto- rock singer-songwriter and film actress from Hong Kong. Formerly the lead vocalist of the band Black and Blue, Lo launched her solo career in 1998 and is best known for the singles, \"Trash\" (\u5783\u573e) and \"Please Break Up\" (\u597d\u5fc3\u5206\u624b).",
        "early_life": "In 1998, Lo signed with Sony Music Hong Kong to launch a career as a solo artist. Her first release under Sony was the EP Don't Have to be...Too Perfect (\u4e0d\u9700\u8981...\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5f97\u53ef\u6015) which contained the breakthrough radio-hit \"Trash\" (\u5783\u573e), considered one of her signature songs. Although \"Trash\" was a fairly mainstream ballad, the rest of the EP showed a continuity with her indie past. Lo would later ditch Keith Chan and Wyman Wong who had a dominant presence on the EP to work with entirely different songwriters and lyricists for her debut album. Released in late 1998, Lo's first full-length solo album was titled Miao, which referred to her love of cats and how \"they listen while people sometimes don't.\"Miao was apparently released to \"more than disappointing\" album sales and low radio airplay, with producer Kubert Leung remarking that the public had \"failed to grasp the concept of the album.\"Lo's second album, Getting Closer to Candy Lo (\u8cbc\u8fd1\u76e7\u5de7\u97f3) (1999), represented a more conscious attempt to connect with a mainstream audience, while retaining a sense of the unique individualism found in Miao. The album continued to set Lo's music apart from the mainstream. It contained five of her compositions, including the single \"Regeneration,\" (\u65b0\u9673\u4ee3\u8b1d) which was influenced by 70's art rock. Upon release, the album garnered her some comparisons as \"Hong Kong's Faith Yang\". Art direction for the album was done by William Chang.\nA substantially more commercial direction was signalled by the release of 2002's Appreciating the Taste of Life (\u8cde\u5473\u4eba\u9593), which gave Lo her first-ever smash hit, \"Please Break Up\" (\u597d\u5fc3\u5206\u624b). The song topped the charts and won her year-end awards at all four of Hong Kong's major radio and TV stations, making it a career highlight for Lo. A duet version of the song was recorded with Taiwan singer Leehom Wang to accompany the second edition of the album. The song remains one of the most frequently requested songs at Hong Kong karaoke bars to this day.\nIn May 2003, Lo held her first stadium concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum, True Music 1st Flight Live 2003, performing for two nights. This coincided with the release of the album Candy's Airline (\u7cd6\u679c\u822a\u7a7a), which spawned one of her biggest hits, \"Love Triangle\" (\u4e09\u89d2\u8a8c), and was followed up later in the year by Flower Talk (\u82b1\u8a00.\u5de7\u8a9e) which contained a further hit, \"Fall & Blossom\" (\u843d\u5730\u958b\u82b1).\nAfter a string of radio-friendly albums, Lo released her final album with Sony, Evolution Theory (\u5929\u6f14\u8ad6) in 2005, which returned to her alternative musical roots and is one of her most uncompromising albums to date. Like Flower Talk which preceded it, the album contains lyrics which deal with Buddhist themes.\nLo married Sammy So, lead singer of the band Kolor, in April 2013.\n",
