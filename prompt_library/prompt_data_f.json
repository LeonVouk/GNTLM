She spent most of her school years during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u201345), and had to move repeatedly with her family from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, Shaoguan, and Lian County, because of the war.After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou resumed its admissions. Ye hoped to study literature at the university, but her father wanted her to study medicine for better career prospects. She was not interested in medicine, and as a compromise with her father, she agreed to study mathematics instead. At the time, mathematics and astronomy were under the same department at Sun Yat-sen University, and under the influence of Professor Zou Yixin, she later chose to major in astronomy.\nIn 1951, Ye Shuhua moved to Shanghai with her husband Cheng Jitai (\u7a0b\u6781\u6cf0), who taught at the mathematics department of Fudan University. Ye found work at the French-built Zikawei (Xujiahui) Observatory, which later became part of Shanghai Astronomical Observatory. In 1958, she became the leader of a team of scientists working to improve the precision of China's measurement of Universal Time, which ranked the last in the world. By 1963, China's Universal Time measurement leapt to the world's second most precise. It was set as the basic national standard in 1965, and her team later received many national awards for this achievement.When the Cultural Revolution started in 1966, Ye Shushua, like many other intellectuals, was persecuted and held in a \"cowshed\" (\u725b\u68da). She also had to work as a house painter.After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Ye was appointed research professor of Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, and served as its director between 1981 and 1993. Under her leadership, Shanghai Observatory established a very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) and a satellite laser ranging (SLR) research station, and participated in the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) as one of the most technologically advanced bases. In 1991, she was appointed the chief scientist in a Key Basic Research Project to study China's crustal motion. The project verified that the Indian Plate is causing an eastward movement of China's land mass.Ye Shuhua served as Vice-President of the Chinese Astronomical Society from 1978 to 1988, after which she became its honorary president. She served as Vice-President of the International Astronomical Union from 1988 to 1994. She was elected a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1980, and a foreign fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society of Britain in 1985.\n",

Before 1996, AZT and other early 1990s antiretroviral medication were prescribed in single therapy, which still did not prevent progression to fatal full-blown AIDS. In the mid 1990s, his research team conducted a series of elegant human studies to elucidate the dynamics of HIV replication in vivo. This knowledge, in turn, formed the foundation for their pioneering effort to treat HIV \"early and hard\" and in demonstrating for the first time the durable control of HIV replication in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy, which had subsequently developed by scientists at NIAID and Merck. This was the turning point in the epidemic that an automatic death sentence was transformed into a manageable disease.For the past decade and a half, Ho has shifted his research focus to developing strategies to prevent HIV transmission. A protective vaccine against HIV remains elusive despite concerted research efforts. However, Ho has been leading non-vaccine approaches to block HIV transmission that have shown considerable promise. His group was the first to demonstrate protective efficacy of a long-acting antiretroviral drug as pre-exposure prophylaxis in rhesus macaques. In fact, one such agent, cabotegravir, has recently completed Phase-3 efficacy trials in high-risk populations, in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. In parallel, Ho's group has also engineered exquisitely potent antibodies that neutralize divergent strains of HIV. The most promising neutralizing agent is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that entered a first-in-human clinical trial in 2019 with the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The Ho Lab is funded by two NIH grants to pursue the use of engineered antibodies to purge the viral latent reservoir as a part of the international HIV cure effort.\nHo has published more than 500 research papers as of February 2020.Ho is a member of the Committee of 100, a Chinese American leadership organization, in addition to several scientific groups.Ho is currently leading a team, funded by Jack Ma Foundation, to look for a vaccine for the COVID-19 virus and believes that other treatments that may become effective against COVID-19 should be examined.\nHo has three older children: Kathryn, Jonathan, and Jaclyn. He lives with his partner, Tera Wong, and their child, Jerren Ho. His family's ancestral home is Xinyu, Jiangxi Province.\n",

At the same time he pursued a musical career as a rapper. In early 2003 he completed his first music video for the song he had recorded with three other rappers. Zlotin presented this video to regional TV stations, some of which included it in their program. Upon receiving positive feedback and requests from a number of Ukrainian hip-hop musicians, he decided to focus on the production of music videos. In 2004 he moved to Cologne to study media design for picture and sound at the Georg-Simon-Ohm vocational college. As his final project, Zlotin shot a short film \"Das Geburtstagsgeschenk\", where the rapper Eko Fresh appears for the first time as an actor.In 2007, together with Christian Schmitz and Malic Bargiel, Zlotin founded the media production company, StreetCinema, in Cologne, with which he subsequently produced commercials, image films and music videos. The company mostly specialized in the production of music videos, whereby they were responsible for the whole production process, from the conception through the technical implementation to post-production. Initially, StreetCinema mainly shot music videos for Eko Fresh and members of its German Dream label such as Farid Bang, Capkekz, SDiddy, Summer Cem and Manuellsen. In 2011 Zlotin began to shoot for pop musicians such as Revolverheld, Menowin Fr\u00f6hlich, Tom Gaebel, Maite Kelly and Willi Herren. Later, while working on the video Massaka Kokain 2 of Massiv, he collaborated for the first time with Kollegah, the rapper contracted by the Selfmade Records. Zlotin continued to collaborate with the D\u00fcsseldorf label, for video creations by Favorite, Karate Andi and the 257ers, followed by a series of productions with Xatar and SSIO of Alles oder Nix Records.\nAccording to Zlotin, the years 2013 and 2014 represented the boom phase of StreetCinema. Six to seven projects per month were realized during this time. Among others, first videos for Olli Banjo, KC Rebell and artists from Bushido\u00b4s music label Ersguterjunge, such as Baba Saad and Shindy, were created during this period. With the video Bleib in der Schule cooperation with artists from the music label Trailerpark was started. As of 2015, Zlotin made several videos for Majoe, Jasko, Mike Singer and MC Bilal. A year later, he completed his biggest project yet - a music video Boom Boom, which he co-directed with Said Naciri. The music video of RedOne, Daddy Yankee and French Montana received 23 million views on the first day. After one year, it has achieved nearly 120 million views. StreetCinema was dissolved with the approval of all three shareholders in the spring of 2018. Since then, Zlotin has been working under his own brand.\n",

In the 2016 Legislative Council election, Ho replaced Frederick Fung who lost his District Council seat to run in District Council (Second) for ADPL.

Fung later lost in the pro-democracy primary. Ho and other young ADPL members strongly opposed Fung's intention to run in another Kowloon West by-election, which led to Fung's departure from the party.In the 2020 Legislative Council election, Ho contested in the pro-democracy primaries for the nomination in Kowloon West.

The group stood accused of the organisation of and participation in unofficial primary elections held by the camp in July 2020.

He studied international communism at the Central China Normal University and also has a doctorate in law. In 1994, he took charge of the Wuhan securities commission. In September 1995, he became party chief of Wuchang District. In December 1997, he was named secretary-general of the Wuhan party committee. In March 1998, the mayor of Huangshi; in November 2011, the secretary-general of the Hubei provincial government; in December 2002, the party chief of Xiangfan; in September 2004, the Vice-Governor of Hubei.\nHe was named mayor of Wuhan in January 2008. In January 2011, he was promoted to party chief of Wuhan; as party boss of the provincial capital, he also sat on the Hubei provincial Party Standing Committee.\nAfter Ruan ascended to leading positions in Wuhan, abundant construction activity took place all over the city. Some 5,500 construction sites were operating simultaneously. Some Wuhan locals named him \"Manchengwa\" (\u6ee1\u57ce\u6316), a play on his name that literally meant \"digs all over town.\" To this, Ruan responded, \"I'm not scared of people calling me 'Manchengwa'. If we're not doing construction, we are doing a disservice to the city.\" The intense construction work was blamed for extensive flooding after heavy rain in June 2011.Ruan was credited with explosive infrastructure growth, such as the construction of the Second Ring Road of Wuhan, the Baishazhou Avenue, and the Wuhan Metro Line 8. The projects significantly reduced commute times and eased congestion across the city. However, the endless construction also burdened the city's financial system. In 2011, total planned investment amounted to over 70 billion yuan (~$10 billion). To recoup the massive construction costs, the city issued debt through special financial vehicles, backed up by municipal land as collateral, which typically did not show up on the city's balance sheet (although this practice was common in other Chinese cities as well, at the time), including perpetual bonds.\nHaving been born in Wuhan and having spent his entire career in his home province, it seemed like Ruan's career was headed to an unceremonious close as he approached the mandatory retirement age for sub-provincial level officials of 60. However, in December 2016, Ruan suddenly transferred to Yunnan province.  On December 13, Ruan was appointed as the Governor of Yunnan. On December 28, at the dedication ceremony of the Shanghai\u2013Kunming High-Speed Railway in Kunming, Ruan mispronounced the abbreviation of the province Zhen instead of Dian while reading off of a script, prompting mockery online, including comments that a doctorate in law should know better.In November 2020, Ruan was appointed as the CCP Secretary of Yunnan.\n",

From 1992 to 2014 he worked with Northamptonshire Archaeology as Senior Project Officer, during which time he directed many projects, particularly the excavations of large landscapes in English and Welsh quarries. Starting in about 1993 Meadows began digging in a gravel pit in Wollaston, Northamptonshire, ultimately leading to both the discovery of the first definitive evidence of viticulture from Roman Britain, and the unearthing of the Pioneer Helmet, only the fourth Anglo-Saxon helmet to be found.In 1996, while leading a team with Tony Brown of the University of Exeter's School of Geography and Archaeology, Meadows discovered the first evidence for viticulture from Roman Britain. The find followed the excavation of a series of farms from the Iron and Roman ages, and was soon followed by the discovery of vineyards in the Nene Valley. By 1999 Meadows had found evidence of seven vineyards: four in Northamptonshire, one in Cambridgeshire, one in Lincolnshire and one in Buckinghamshire. One site alone had four miles of trenches, enough to produce about 10,000 litres of wine annually. The seven vineyards covered a combined 30 acres, suggesting to Meadows that \"research may yet reveal that Britain was a major wine producer in ancient times.\"The year after discovering the Roman vineyards, in 1997 Meadows discovered the Anglo-Saxon Pioneer Helmet. Also found in Wollaston, it was part of the inhumation of a high-status Anglo-Saxon man, and was found with a pattern welded sword and a hanging bowl. News of the find made newspapers as far away as Australia and New Zealand, for the helmet was only the fourth contemporaneous example to be discovered, coming after those from Benty Grange, Sutton Hoo, and York, and before two subsequent discoveries from Shorwell and Staffordshire.As of 2016, Meadows is leading the excavations at Chester Farm, a walled Roman town with 10,000 years of history.

He completed his MA and PhD at the University of Rochester, working under the supervision of American labour historian Herbert Gutman and Christopher Lasch on a dissertation that examined the Toronto working class during the transition to industrial capitalism. He would later publish this work in the Canadian Historical Association's Macdonald prize-winning book Toronto Workers Respond to Industrial Capitalism (1980). He followed this work with the co-authored (with Bryan Palmer), the CHA and AHA Corey prize-winning Dreaming of What Might Be: The Knights of Labor in Ontario (1982).\nIn 1976 Kealey helped found the journal Labour/Le Travail to provide an outlet for a new generation of scholars practising the \"new labour and working-class history,\" influenced by the work of E. P. Thompson and the Marxist tradition. He edited the journal from 1976 to 1997, when Bryan Palmer took over as editor. He returned briefly in 2016\u201317 as a co-editor, first with Bryan Palmer and then with Charles Smith. The journal, published by the Canadian Committee on Labour History, also produced books in the field under the CCLH imprint, many of which Kealey has edited. Kealey and his peers also co-operatively ran New Hogtown Press, a successor to the earlier Hogtown Press, publishing a number of books and left-wing pamphlets in the 1970s and 1980s in an attempt to provide a model of a non-profit socialist enterprise within a capitalist society.\n",

As a teen, she entered the Miss Alabama pageant, where she won a scholarship to a local acting school for one year. She began co-hosting a locally produced \"Morning Show\" on WBRC-TV in Birmingham, but when she was denied a raise, she quit her job and decided to move to New York City.\nAs her acting career began, Flagg could not use her birth name professionally, as there was already a well-known actress named Patricia Neal registered with Actors' Equity. Having only an hour to choose a stage name, she selected the first name \"Fannie\" at the suggestion of her grandfather, who recalled it being used by many comediennes in the vaudeville circuit, and \"Flagg\" at the suggestion of a friend.\nFlagg has spoken publicly about being dyslexic. She has expressed the great challenge of being a writer, saying, \"I was, am, severely dyslexic and couldn't spell, still can't spell. So I was discouraged from writing and embarrassed.\" Even though it was clear that she had an affinity for crafting stories, her dyslexia stalled any possible writing career through most of the 1970s. It was not until a teacher spotted a pattern in Flagg's misspelled written answers on Match Game and sent her a note that she understood she had a learning disability; Flagg later stated she had not heard of the condition prior to this note. Eventually, Flagg was able to overcome her fear associated with the disorder and has since completed several novels.In the mid-1970s, Flagg shared a house in Charlottesville, Virginia  with American writer Rita Mae Brown, whom she met at a party in the Hollywood Hills hosted by Marlo Thomas.

In 2013, the British Virgin Islands financial services discovered that Alaa Mubarak owned 'Pan World Investments', an investment fund for the Mubarak family of nearly $1 billion incorporated by Mossack Fonseca, who said he was introduced to them by Credit Suisse.In September 2018, Alaa was arrested along with his brother Gamal, and accused of manipulating the stock market. Alaa's corruption conviction, along with the corruption convictions of his father and brother, was upheld by Egypt's Court of Cassation the same month as well. Both Alaa and his brother were later acquitted in February 2020 of the 2018 illicit share trading charge.On 12 March 2021, the European Union revoked the sanctions against nine Egyptian individuals including Mubarak family, adopted since 2011.\nMubarak is married to Heidy Rasekh, with whom he has had two sons, Muhammad and Omar Alaa Mubarak. Muhammad died on 18 May 2009, aged 12. It was announced that he had suffered a 'severe health crisis', which was identified as a brain haemorrhage. He was checked into the Maadi Military Hospital for a couple of hours before being flown to Paris for further care, where he later died. His body was returned and buried in Cairo.\n",

Of these, the 2001 release Pimps Don't Pay Taxes, was particularly noted; it featured rappers Huggy Bear and Al-Shid, for whom he would subsequently produce a number of 12\" releases. In 2003, The New York Times cited his J-Zone, S.A. Smash concert in Brooklyn, New York as a noteworthy pop and jazz concert in the New York metropolitan region.Not finding commercial success, J-Zone eventually walked away from rap, and in 2011 published the book Root for the Villain: Rap, Bullshit and a Celebration of Failure. The book has been well received; the Los Angeles Times Music Blog stated that \"Like his albums, it's equal parts hilarious, self-effacing and sharp. He's the sarcastic older brother putting you up on game. It's a love letter to rap laced with sulfur, the flip side of Dan Charnas' similarly excellent The Big Payback.\" The Washington Post Going Out Gurus blog called it \"a must for every curmudgeonly grown-up hip-hop head\", while Nathan Rabin writing for The A.V. Club called it \"one of the funniest and most honest books ever written about the modern music industry and its luckless casualties.\"In 2013, J-Zone returned to music with the release of the album, Peter Pan Syndrome, which was listed as the 17th best album of 2013 by Spin. After learning to play drums seriously during his hiatus from music, J-Zone released the drum break album, Lunch Breaks, in 2014.In 2016 J-Zone landed a spot playing drums on new tunes from the 1970s funk band Manzel, his band The Du-Rites with Tom Tom Club guitarist Pablo Martin, and for personal drum break kits for Danger Mouse and others.J-Zone has continued working as a session drummer in recent years, appearing on Lord Finesse's Motown State of Mind album in 2020, in addition to his drums being sampled on the 2020 Madlib single, \"Road of The Lonely Ones\".In 2022, J-Zone was the drummer for live shows and select recordings for The Black Pumas guitarist Adrian Quesada's Boleros Psicodelicos album.\n",

He initially worked on Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II as a debugger but first became genuinely involved with game development while creating sound effects for Final Fantasy III. His next major role was as the designer of the Active Time Battle system for Final Fantasy IV. Square filed a Japanese patent application related to the ATB system on 16 July 1991 and a corresponding US application on 16 March 1992. One Japanese patent (JP2794230) and two US patents (US5390937 and US5649862) were granted based on these applications. For Final Fantasy V, Ito designed the fully customizable Job system. He also created the 'Chicken Knife or Brave Blade' choosing event. Final Fantasy VI marked the first time that Ito became a director on a game. For this title, he was in charge of all battle aspects. He was also responsible for the battle systems in Final Fantasy VIII and Final Fantasy Tactics before he once more took on the role of director with Final Fantasy IX. Ito had the idea to make its protagonist Zidane Tribal flirtatious towards women.In mid-2005, Square Enix announced that Yasumi Matsuno had left the company due to an illness but would be acting as a supervisor on Final Fantasy XII. Ito was appointed as the director of the game. Matsuno apologized for the long development time of the project but guaranteed players that it was \"progressing in its development under the hands of excellent staffs\". Ito created the License Board of Final Fantasy XII with the intention to give the player much freedom in developing characters to their liking without becoming too complicated. At the Square Enix Party 2007 pre-conference meeting in May 2007, he was introduced on stage as the producer and director of the newly announced Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System. He stated later that he considered the game design and battle system of Final Fantasy XII a \"definitive contribution to the gaming lexicon\" and that it had \"the potential to shine in future games\". In about 2012, Ito was tasked by producer Shinichi Tatsuke with the creation of a battle system for a new game. However, the plan changed and he was told a week later that there was a different project to consider. Tatsuke now requested a concept for a social game which he felt was an interesting opportunity to have Ito work on, given his experience with simple Nintendo Entertainment System game systems. This concept became Guardian Cross. In September 2012, Ito said that he would work on another Final Fantasy game if the company's president wished for it. The corporate executive of Square Enix's 1st Production Department, Shinji Hashimoto, mentioned in July 2013 that Ito was \"planning and doing some proposals for a new project\" and \"putting some ideas together\".\n",

The Bantustan, which would later become part of the Eastern Cape, is a prominent feature in his fiction. In a 2020 interview with arts24, when asked about the prevalence of \"machine logic\" and \"homelands\" in his work, and whether or not this was autobiographical, Ntshanga said: I think all writing is autobiographical. That it emerges from the same biographical detail: how the author perceives and arranges their world. It\u2019s true, though, machine logic and the homelands do inform how I perceive and arrange mine. I\u2019m still investigating the cause behind this, but I suspect it might have to do with the fact that the homelands themselves were technologies of conquest. That I was born into a malfunctioning machine. In 1992, after the Bisho massacre, Ntshanga's family moved to King William's Town, where he attended an English medium school for the first time. Later, Ntshanga attended boarding school at St Gregory College, in Estcourt, where he became School Dux. In 2004, he matriculated from St Charles College in Pietermaritzburg, where he'd begun to write, placing his first story in the South African counterculture journal Laugh It Off at eighteen.Ntshanga attended the University of Cape Town, where he continued to write and publish short stories in local literary journals. He completed a BA in Film and Media and an Honours degree in English Studies, before enrolling for the university's MA in Creative Writing program, working under the Mellon Mays Foundation. He was awarded an NRF Freestanding Masters Scholarship and in the program, Ntshanga was supervised by the South African novelist and academic, Imraan Coovadia.\nNative Life in the Third Millennium was published in 2020 by Model See Media, also known as MDL SEE, Ntshanga's experimental press, which he established during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. It was released as a limited edition chapbook of 100 signed and numbered copies and distributed exclusively through independent South African bookstores. In the chapbook, a hybrid of interlinking poetry and prose, a philosopher, poet and programmer reflect on existence in millennial Africa. The book elaborates on Ntshanga's longstanding themes: addiction, mental illness, assimilation, technology, friendship, alienation and colonialism. In a Bubblegum Club interview with the author, Nkgopoleng Moloi wrote: \"Sometimes classified as urban fiction, science fiction, political fiction and \u2018coming of age\u2019 stories, Ntshanga\u2019s work is difficult to contain and is often a dance of binaries inching us closer towards the frigid and boundless voids of the human condition.\" For OkayAfrica, Rofhiwa Maneta wrote: \"Ntshanga's swirling prose poses philosophical questions about what it means to be alive, the different mechanisms we use to keep the heaviness of being at a remove, and how the freight of our colonial past reaches into the future.\"\n",

She went on to become the first female student to enroll in a graduate program in medical biophysics at the University of Toronto (1967-69). Robert A. Phillips supervised Wu's Master's in Science degree (MSc) research. Her thesis, titled Differentiation of Rosette-forming Cells from Clones of Hemopoietic Stem Cells, was supported by two consecutive graduate scholarships from NSERC and the Medical Research Council of Canada (CIHR). Wu's early interest in immunology was encouraged by Hardy Cinader.When she began her Master's degree (1967), she was the only graduate studies female student in the department.\nAfter completing her MSc, Wu did not proceed directly to pursue a doctorate. Instead, she worked as a biophysics technician at the Donner Radiation Labs in UC Berkeley (1969-71), and was a research associate at the National Cancer Institute, NIH, in Bethesda, Maryland, US (1975-76). \nIn 1980, she began her PhD studies at the University of Toronto in medical genetics under the supervision of Helios Murialdo, which resulted in four publications, including one in Cell.

She has said that \"being a black and Native kid in Fort Worth in the '70s and '80s was pretty limiting\"; thus, she turned to reading and writing, especially science fiction, as a form of escape. Her father was an economics professor, and her mother was a high school English teacher who encouraged Rebecca's early attempts at writing stories.Roanhorse graduated from Yale University and later earned her JD degree from the University of New Mexico School of Law, specializing in Federal Indian Law and lived for several years on the Navajo Nation, where she clerked at the Navajo Supreme Court before working as an attorney.In a 2020 profile by Vulture magazine, Roanhorse said that at 7 years old she learned from looking at her birth certificate that she is \"half-Black and half\u2013Spanish Indian\". She said that when she reunited with her birth family after college, it \"hadn\u2019t gone as she\u2019d hoped,\" and that she and her mother rarely speak, \"but she thought that there were other ways she might be able to connect with her Native heritage.\" Roanhorse has said that she is of Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo descent through her mother's family, and African American on her father's side. When she began publishing and doing speaking engagements, others pointed out that she is not an enrolled member of any tribal community. Leaders of the Ohkay Owingeh community have stated that Roanhorse is not enrolled there and has no connection to their community. Dr. Matthew Martinez, former Lieutenant Governor of Ohkay Owingeh, welcomed Roanhorse on her first and only visit to the community, in 2018, and spent time with her. He said, \"I recognize that adoption is an emotional experience for families and communities and especially those who have been adopted out with no real connection to home....At Ohkay Owingeh, our current enrollment process privileges family lineage and not blood quantum.\" Agoyo explained that \"anyone who descends from an Ohkay family - as Roanhorse has publicly claimed - can become a citizen. But Martinez said the author has chosen a different path.\" Martinez continued, \"by not engaging in any form of cultural and community acknowledgement, Roanhorse has failed to establish any legitimate claim to call herself Ohkay Owingeh.\" He eventually concluded, \"It is unethical for Roanhorse to be claiming Ohkay Owingeh and using this identity to publish Native stories.\"She currently lives in New Mexico with her husband, who is Navajo, and their daughter.\nRoanhorse told The New York Times that she initially worked on \"Tolkien knockoffs about white farm boys going on journeys\", because she figured that is what readers wanted.On August 19, 2020, Roanhorse was announced as a contributing writer to Marvel Comics' Marvel's Voices: Indigenous Voices #1 anthology, which was released in November 2020.

He studied Roman and Slavic languages at the University of Vienna and Rome. He speaks Neapolitan, Italian, German, English, French, Spanish and Polish; furthermore, he developed an affection for music, inspired by the classic Italian and Neapolitan songs that his parents would record from vinyl onto cassettes to be played for the clients at his father's restaurant.\nHe is happily married with a daughter who currently resides in Austria. His daughter's name is Alina Josephine.\nBuanne participated and won several talent competitions between the ages of 11 and 17. which led to small musical productions and gigs with his self-formed 50's rock and roll band and as a solo performer followed.\nWhen he was 17, a music industry manager proposed a performance on the occasion of the Papal visit in Wroclaw, Poland. The song, which was half in Italian and half in Polish, had been written for the opening mass, and with 85,000 people in attendance, the exposure led to his first record named Angelo di Dio in 1997. Tragically, it was also to be the year that his father died from virulent cancer, and the subsequent grief became such that Patrizio almost lost his own life to a perforated ulcer.At age 19, Buanne graduated from school in Vienna and moved to Naples and later Rome. There he attended university to study languages, while looking for opportunities in the entertainment industry in Italy. He was a guest performer and entertainer on Italian television shows such as Momenti di Gloria, Domenica In and Libero. This success led to a contract with a production company that made shows for RAI and Mediaset. Due to the limited offered international opportunities in Italy, Buanne started to shape his own ideas and concepts.\nBuanne approached several producers with the idea of recording a collection of romantic Italian songs with an orchestra, which was his real ambition, forged by 5 years of shaping and developing his ideas as an independent artist. The objective behind recording that particular genre was, on one hand, to let people know that \u201cItalian music is not just opera or classical\u201d, and on the other hand, to honor his father.\nThat same year, he released Life is Beautiful - Dankie-Suid Afrika (Universal-EMI Music), an album of South African pop standards, in which he recorded alongside singers such as Ladysmith Black Mambazo, duets in Afrikaans; as well as in Italian and English, being awarded by the South African Music Industry with the \"SA\u2019s Ambassadors Award\".\n",

Previously, he had helped the reserves to reach the final of the 1979\u201380 Copa del Rey against the parent club, losing 6\u20131; they thus qualified for the subsequent edition of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, where the player featured in the 3\u20131 first-round victory over West Ham United and retired at the hour mark with a patella fracture.Following a one-year loan at Real Oviedo, Juanito signed permanently with the Asturias side in summer 1984. He joined fellow second-tier Rayo Vallecano for the 1987\u201388 campaign; during his tenure, he experienced both promotion and relegation, shared teams with the likes of Laurie Cunningham and Diego Maradona's brother Hugo and notably scored twice in a 3\u20133 draw with Castilla on 24 April 1988 (once in his own net).Juanito retired at the end of 1989\u201390 aged only 29 due to injuries, with Rayo having finished last.

She was awarded a full scholarship to study the Natural Sciences Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge. During her summer holidays from Cambridge, Zlatic studied linguistics and Russian at the University of Zagreb. Alongside her studies, Zlatic was involved with the Cambridge theatre scene, taking part in Greek tragedies and Shakespeare's plays. As an undergraduate student Zlatic attended the lectures of Mike Bate, where he discussed the neural circuits of fruit flies. She enjoyed the lectures so much that she applied for a postgraduate degree. During her doctoral research Zlatic looked at the development of neurons in Drosophila. As the nervous system starts to form, neurons start to produce axons and dendrites. Zlatic showed that sensory neurons, which allow for sight, sound, pain and touch, look for particular locations in the nervous system using positional cues.\nAfter earning her doctorate, Zlatic was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Cambridge which allowed her to travel internationally and study the assembly of neural circuits. In 2009 Zlatic started her independent career at the Janelia Research Campus. At Janelia she learnt about the genetic tools used to manipulate the types of neurons in Drosophila. Zlatic has dedicated her career to the study of the nervous system, in particular the positional cue known as the slit protein which controls how sensory neuron axons start and stop growing. She showed that slit proteins control branching along the mediolateral axis but not the dorsoventral axis, indicating that there are positional cues in three-dimensions.Zlatic is interested the complex functions of the human brain, including language and communication. She studies these phenomena in the Drosophila larva (maggot). She made use of electron microscopy to map the entire Drosophila connectome, and studies the strengths of the connections between neurons that are structurally connected. By investigating the connectivity of these neurons it is hoped that these particular patterns could be associated with the formation of memories.\nZlatic is fluent in several languages, including Croatian, English, German, French, Russian, Spanish, Italian, Ancient Greek, and Latin. Alongside her enthusiasm for languages and neuroscience, Zlatic is an actress. She is married to neuroscientist Albert Cardona.\n\n\n== References ==\n",

From a young age, she was deeply fascinated by medieval European paraphernalia, and with the influence from foreign juvenile novel series such as the Bartimaeus Sequence, The Saga of Darren Shan, and The Seventh Tower, Kobashiri decided to become a fantasy novelist.When she submitted her work for the 15th Dengeki Novel Prize, it reached the second round before being rejected. A few years later, Kobashiri's submission to a female-orientated label reached the final round. Under the name Koketa Kobashiri (\u864e\u8d70\u3053\u3051\u305f, Kobashiri Koketa), she submitted Grimoire of Zero for the 20th Dengeki Novel Prize and won it. After changing her pen name to Kakeru Kobashiri, she debuted as a novelist under this name on 10 February 2014. Grimoire of Zero received a manga adaptation in December of the same year, in October 2015 a spinoff manga started publishing, and the series received an anime adaptation in 2017. Grimoire of Zero finished publishing in December 2017 with 11 volumes.\nIn August 2018, under Kodansha's LIGHT NOVEL imprint, Kobashiri started publishing a sequel to her previous work called The Dawn of the Witch. Just like its predecessor, it received a manga adaptation and an anime adaptation was announced in 2021.In 2019, she was in-charge of writing the main scenario for the mobile game Kurosu \u00d7 Rogusu (\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u00d7\u30ed\u30b4\u30b9).\nKobashiri has said she enjoys royal road adventure stories and romantic comedies, and that Grimoire was her way of writing a combination of both. Being that Grimoire had a therianthropic protagonist and her work generally being filled with such characters, many speculate that Kobashiri particularly enjoys kemonomimi. However, she denies this rumor, stating \"what interests her most is the dynamic found in human-nonhuman relationships\" which she says extends to human-robot and human-monster relationships also. Kobashiri likes video games, and reading children's literature, picture books, manga, and movies, and has stated that Grimoire was influenced by novels such as The Lord of the Rings, The Saga of Darren Shan, Kino's Journey, and Slayers, as well as manga such as Bastard!! and Berserk. As a technical high school graduate, where she was the only female student in her class, she says she cannot write novels based on school life.In describing her how she writes, Kobashiri says that she first creates the characters before molding the setting and storyline around them. In addition, she says she is always conscious of her prose's rhythm and the tempo of her story, being careful not to distract the reader with minutiae, especially during dialogue, and avoids using difficult words and kanji as much as possible.\n",

Her role went largely unnoticed due to the film being based around Arjun's action image, with a critic labelling her performance as \"adequate\". After the release of Madrasi, Vedhika went on to sign a big budget Hindi language film, Jai Santoshi Maa, a remake of the 1975 film of the same name, but the film failed to subsequently materialize and Vedhika continued acting in South Indian films. She went on to feature in Raghava Lawrence's comedy horror Muni, but her role was minimal once again and the film went to become an average grosser commercially. Her maiden Telugu venture was in Vijayadasami, a remake of the Tamil film Sivakasi, where her performance was described as \"okay\" and \"average\" by critics.Her first release in 2008, the Silambarasan-starrer Kaalai, received negative reviews and became a commercial failure. However, the film became notable for the dance number, \"Kutti Pisase\" with Vedhika's dancing being critically appreciated.

The long-delayed film featured Shanthnoo Bhagyaraj making his debut in the lead role and A. R.

The film had little scope for Vedhika and reviews cited her role as \"pure eye candy\" whilst claiming she was \"apt\" for the role. She made a comeback to Telugu films in the same year, with a role in the critically acclaimed Baanam. Her role won her plaudits, whilst her on screen presence with Nara Rohit was praised with a critic citing she gives \"good company as the na\u00efve girl\" and it is \"refreshing to see them together\".

He joined a company as a trainee and intended to become a vocalist by age 22 before giving up. He enlisted in mandatory military service and was discharged in 2016. After completing his service, he deliberated between being a pop music composer or a self-produced artist.\nPeakboy came up with his stage name the day before registering it with the Korea Copyright Commission. \"Peak\" refers to the peak point which arises when making music, and \"boy\" was attached due to its regular usage in the monikers of foreign record producers. Early in his career, Peakboy composed music for girl group Hello Venus. He would go on to take part in songwriting and production for other musicians, including on Urban Zakapa's \"Another Me\" (2015) and Kkal & Maxx's debut record Caffe in the Morning (2016).

While studying chemical engineering at National Kaohsiung Institute of Technology, Yu danced for recreation, performance, and competitive purposes. Following compulsory military service, Yu studied dance privately with Li Dan. He subsequently enrolled at Chinese Culture University, where he was taught by Wu Man-li and Gao Yan. Yu joined the institution's Hwa Kang Dance Troupe. After working with the Youth Goodwill Mission, Yu's scholarship to the Royal Conservatory of The Hague came into effect. Upon Yu's return to Taiwan in 1984, he found that there were little opportunity to perform. Through contacts at the Royal Conservatory, Yu auditioned for the Ballet royal de Wallonie of Charleroi. Yu later performed throughout Germany, namely at the Musiktheater im Revier, Theater Osnabr\u00fcck, and Landestheater Coburg. At the Musiktheater im Revier, Yu received his first experience as a choreographer. With Theater Osnabr\u00fcck, Yu was made ballet master. In 2001, Yu joined Oper Graz as deputy ballet director and choreographer. While with Graz, Yu has worked with the National Moravian-Silesian Theatre, as well as other companies. Yu has been acknowledged as the first male Taiwanese professional dancer in Europe and the first Taiwanese director of a European ballet company.\nYu worked with the Chamber Ballet Taipei and its cofounder Chiang Chiou-o on a part-time basis from 1994 to 1998. He served as the troupe's artistic director, ballet master and choreographer. He rejected a 1998 offer to lead the troupe outright, and the company became inactive. Yu's next performance in Taiwan was in 2003, with Wu Su-fen's Taipei Ballet Company. In 2006, Yu reestablished Chamber Ballet Taipei. He again served as the reincarnated troupe's artistic director and choreographer. As a part-time venture, the troupe was most active when Yu spent vacations in Taiwan. In the spring, Yu would host auditions, and spend summer in rehearsal. Under Yu's leadership, the Chamber Ballet Taipei's performances regularly featured live orchestral music, often by the Evergreen Symphony Orchestra. At the time, the playing of live music alongside ballet performances was considered a rarity in Taiwan. Yu has frequently featured the music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in his own work, and, in 2013, restaged Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake at Metropolitan Hall in Taipei. In 2015, Yu left Oper Graz to focus on Chamber Ballet Taipei, which he renamed Formosa Ballet. That same year, Yu was named the Tainan Municipal Cultural Center's first artistic director.\n",

Reading continues to focus on Southern Hemisphere continental lithosphere, with emphasis on Australia and Antarctica, and technique development in seismology and computational physical sciences.\nReading's career includes multiple field seasons in Antarctica and Australia which expanded the seismic data available for these regions through the deployment of temporary networks of instruments. Using seismic energy as a means of learning about hidden regions of the continents, her work demonstrated the association between the structure of continents at depth, and the history of plate tectonics for that region.In 2014, she led research at the University of Tasmania that developed earthquake technology to track deep ocean storms, which \"play a key role in global climate\". Reading also uses seismology to understand the interaction between glaciers and the bedrock beneath, and coordinates community initiatives in interdisciplinary Antarctic science.Reading was an early pioneer of computational methods that apply machine learning to geoscience data. This has greatly expanded the analysis toolbox for geophysicists in both fundamental and applied research areas. Such approaches have an added benefit of being able to integrate numerical and categorical data in multivariate syntheses. She has also worked on data visualization methods for the geosciences.Reading has served on numerous research strategy and policy development committees including the Australian Academy of Science National Committee for Earth Sciences, and also as Director of the Australian National Facility for Earth Sounding, ANSIR.

His firing in December 2014 by New Republic owner Chris Hughes and his replacement by former Gawker editor Gabriel Snyder provoked an editorial crisis that culminated in the resignation from the magazine of two-thirds of the people on its masthead.In 2017 Foer published World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech, which was named a New York Times 100 Notable Books of 2017. Using Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple as case studies, World Without Mind argues for a closer examination for the role of technology in our lives, particularly the ways it is shaping the values of individuals globally.\nIn October 2022, Foer reported in The Atlantic an in-depth overview of possible legal consequences of activities performed by the former president Donald Trump.\n",

According to Aalto, her parents had decided to give her the name Marja-Sisko if she had been born a girl, as they had hoped. She was preoccupied with the issue of gender from the age of three. Although her parents had wanted a girl, they did not accept her gender identity. For example, they were angry when Aalto, as a child, asked why she could not wear a skirt when all the other girls did.Aalto's coming out as a trans woman caused a great controversy in the Church. The bishop of Mikkeli, Voitto Huotari, commented that there is no juridical obstacle for Aalto continuing as a vicar, but predicted that there would be problems. In 2009, almost 600 members left the Imatra parish. In November 2009, Aalto returned to the job of vicar after spending a year on leave.

He was extremely active as a child and participated in sports such as football, hockey, roller hockey, basketball, and swimming. His interest in wrestling came about through one of his aunts, who was a fan of the World Wrestling Federation. His parents had banned him from watching wrestling at their house, so he would go to his aunt's house to watch it. His favourite wrestlers growing up were The Undertaker and \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan. By the age of 16, he had wrestled with backyard wrestling organizations TWXW in Gateshead and FXW in Middlesbrough. He also visited Scarborough Wrestling Alliance in Scarborough and Essex Championship Wrestling in Essex. Even as one of the younger wrestlers in the group, his technical ability and athleticism ensured he was always in the most entertaining matches. Many of the FXW roster went on to form 3Count Wrestling (3CW), an organization he would later return to. He started training as a wrestler on a more permanent basis at the age of 18 at St Joseph's Hall in Gateshead, which he later described as \"pretty much the only wrestling school in the area\".\nPac utilizes a corkscrew shooting star press, previously known as the \"Red Arrow\", as a finishing maneuver. It is now known as the \"Black Arrow\". After turning into a villain in December 2016, he started using a double underhook crossface submission maneuver called the \"Rings of Saturn\" as a finisher in tribute to Perry Saturn. After leaving WWE, he changed the move's name to \"The Brutalizer\". During his independent career and the first part of his WWE run, he was known as \"The Man That Gravity Forgot\" due to his high-flying style and aerial attacks.After his villainous turn and move to 205 Live, he became known as the \"King of the Cruiserweights\" and adopted the gimmick of a deluded man who referred to himself as a king and viewed the Cruiserweight Championship as his crown. Mark Henry assisted him in creating his villainous character, including methods of agitating the crowd such as climbing up to the top rope to tease his \"Red Arrow\" move, only to jump down without performing the move and lock in a submission. Upon leaving WWE, Pac would tweak his villainous character by dropping the \"king\" aspect and presenting himself as a self-proclaimed \"bastard\" with no morals or empathy.\nSatterley is married and lives a private lifestyle, with no details of his marriage being public. He is a lifelong supporter of his hometown football team Newcastle United FC. He has named The Specials as his favourite band, with his WWE ring name \"Neville\" referencing former band member Neville Staple. He is close friends with fellow wrestlers Bryan Danielson, Kenta, Kevin Owens, Zack Sabre Jr, Shingo Takagi, and Sami Zayn.\n",

After a while, he became a part-time referee, immediately taking advantage of several opportunities to fill in whenever he could. Shortly after, Doan's referee status changed to full-time.One of the more notable incidents in Doan's career came when he participated in an angle on the January 22, 1996 episode of Raw, where Vader made his World Wrestling Federation (WWF) television debut following his debut at the Royal Rumble the  prior night. Vader punched Doan twice in the face, picked him up and power-bombed him to the mat. When on-screen WWF president Gorilla Monsoon intervened, Monsoon picked Doan up off the mat and placed him in the corner. While Monsoon tended to the wounded official, Vader avalanched both of them, kayfabe knocking Doan into unconsciousness. He was out of action for several weeks, selling the injuries he received at the hands of Vader, but eventually reappeared at WrestleMania XII, refereeing another Vader match.\n\nDoan was out of action for about a month with legit stretched ligaments in his knee after Gigolo Jimmy Del Ray, one half of The Heavenly Bodies, accidentally clipped him during a tag match. Doan also suffered a concussion at the 1998 Royal Rumble when Phineas Godwinn was thrown over the top rope and inadvertently kicked him in the back of the head. The Legion of Doom performed a Doomsday Device on Doan at In Your House: Unforgiven 1998.\nDuring The Invasion, he bickered with Alliance referee Charles Robinson.\nDuring the 24/7 ruling of the WWE Hardcore Title where anyone could challenge the champion any time and anywhere, Doan attempted to beat Crash Holly in an impromptu match to win the belt, and went as far as to remove his referee's shirt and persuade fellow referee Jimmy Korderas to count the fall. His attempt, however, was unsuccessful.\nOn a July 2007 episode of Raw, Doan took the microphone from Santino Marella and made a match between him and Umaga, who had just made his entrance during a promo being cut by Marella.

He was then hired by the American Broadcasting Company, where he established the first office of Technology Forecasting for the network. He then became the Vice-President for Science and Technology at the National Cable Television Association (NCTA), followed by an appointment as Chief Engineer to the Congressional Subcommittee on Communications and Technology.Weaver later started Videomagic Laboratories, a company working in vehicular simulators for military and entertainment purposes. He temporarily moved to Los Angeles to work on the Universal Studios lot in Burbank, working on new camera technology with Panavision for interactive media. During this time, Weaver contributed to early work in graphical interfaces, optical storage, and computer-assisted editing, including encoding spatial information for tracking camera shots.In the 1980s, Weaver was introduced to video games when he was asked by one of his engineers to look at a football game idea he was developing. Weaver felt it \"was boring\" and sought to create a more realistic gameplay by incorporating physics. This meant that players would perform based on their masses and accelerations, adding a layer of reality-based strategy to the game. They decided to produce the game, resulting in the formation of Bethesda Softworks. The game was released as Gridiron! for the Atari ST and Commodore 64/128, in 1986. Bethesda later found widespread success as a game developer with its Elder Scrolls series of games.\nIn 1999, Weaver cofounded ZeniMax Media with Robert A.

He joined a folk group named the Ramblers in 1961, playing guitar, and he later played drums in a rock band called the Badd Cedes. He moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1965 and became a cast member for a local CBC Television show called Music Hop. He was a regular performer from 1966 to 1968 on the national variety program called Singalong Jubilee, which was also produced in Halifax. His duets with fellow cast-member and later recording star Anne Murray were well regarded. Also appearing on the show were such recognized performers as Gene MacLellan and John Allan Cameron. After three seasons in Halifax and Montreal, in 1968, Tobias met Bill Medley of the Righteous Brothers who invited him to Los Angeles to record and write as a salaried songwriter. Under the management of Medley's company, Tobias recorded his first single \"You\u2019re Not Even Going to the Fair\" on Bell Records; like many of his early releases it was credited just to \"Tobias\". The song won him his first Canadian BMI award for airplay. This was the first of many BMI, Procan and SOCAN awards.\nIn 1970, he penned \"Stay Awhile\". Though originally conceived as a country-tinged solo piece, the song would emerge as a sensual duet by The Bells and became a soft rock classic of the early 1970s, peaking in 1971 at No. 1 in Canada and No. 7 on the US Billboard charts. \"Stay Awhile\" sold more than two million copies worldwide.\nTobias lived in Toronto through the 1990s before returning to his native Saint John, where he now lives, painting and continuing to write and perform music, and encouraging younger talents through the Songwriters Association of Canada. In 2002, he produced the debut album for Canadian artist Kim Jarrett.

Back in France, she danced with Fran\u00e7ois Raffinot from 1991 to 1996. In 1997, she founded the Sui Generis company. She was noticed early on for her distinctive style.\nIn 1999, she was awarded a Villa Medicis Hors-les murs grant for her research in creating Texture/Composite, for which she was awarded the Prix d\u2019Auteur at the Rencontres chor\u00e9graphiques internationales de Bagnolet in 2000. The piece was subsequently presented at Danspace Project in New York in 2002. Since then her productions have been presented on a regular basis both in France and abroad. In January 2012, Vo-Dinh became the director of Le Phare, Centre Chor\u00e9graphique National du Havre Haute-Normandie, ushering in a new artistic vision that has reached out to a diversity of choreographic styles.\nVo-Dinh's wide-ranging choreography has been shaped through the process of creating new work. While she initially focused on choreographing in a more formal way, her methodology gradually evolved toward an open-ended process affording a prominent role to improvisation in the studio. Surrounded by close collaborators, Vo-Dinh works with her performers on a long-term basis.\nSeveral pieces have been deeply rooted in scientific and anthropological research on human beings, romantic relationships, absence, the lack of emotion and schizophrenia. The art world has also informed her work: between figurative and abstract in the visual arts, as well as in the relationship between bodies in motion and the music of Beethoven, Dusapin, Zeena Parkins or G\u00e9rard Grisey. Although the choreographic structure often draws on minimalism to the point of repeating and transforming a single motif, Vo-Dinh has mainly focused on time, how it is perceived and its relationship to memory and memories. After a long absence, fragmented narration has surfaced in her latest pieces \u2013 a new approach to time and point of view, as well as to the body and how it relates to others.\nVo-Dinh readily accepts invitations, including Rainbow, her piece for amateur dancers in collaboration with David Monceau, and her work with the writer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mauche for Concordanse. Beginning with Histoires Exquises in 2011, she has invited choreographers to create solos from oral testimonies, the starting point for opening up the creative process to audiences. That willingness to share and her curiosity about other approaches to dance were to be the leitmotif in her vision for the CCN du Havre. Since 2012, Vo-Dinh has endeavored to make Le Phare a platform for many different kinds of choreography \u2013 during key moments such as the Pharenheit festival, as well as throughout the year, bringing the CCN to life in order to showcase dance in all it vibrancy.\nSince 2014, she has been the president of the Association des Centres Chor\u00e9graphiques Nationaux, a network comprising nineteen national choreographic centers in France.

He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, the Canadian Psychological Association, the American Academy of Optometry, and the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters.\nMaurice Ptito is a specialist in the study of Development and Plasticity of the visual system in various species including Man. The major goal of his research is the understanding of the mechanisms involved in Visual Plasticity in normal developing individuals, as well as those who were born without vision or lost their vision later in life. His laboratory has been using a wide variety of techniques including anatomy (diffusion tensor imaging, voxel-based morphometry), physiology (visually evoked potentials), positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and psychophysics to study human blindness.\nWith colleague, Dr Ron Kupers (University of Copenhagen), he used a sensory substitution device coined the Tongue Display Unit (TDU) that converts visual images into electrotactile pulses applied to the tongue via a grid made out of tiny electrodes. He demonstrated the presence of cross-modal plastic processes that enable the blind to \"see\" using the tongue as a portal to the visual cortex. This approach holds great promise for the blind in improving their quality of life, helping them to navigate freely in their environment.\n",

This brought him more bookings at bassline events and as time passed, Q produced more hits such as \"Tea Bag\", \"Dirty\" and later \"You Wot!\", which was signed and released via Ministry of Sound. \"You Wot!\" made the UK top 50 upon its release in summer 2008, which led to remix work for the likes of Amy Winehouse, Dizzee Rascal, Keri Hilson and Katy B to name a few.\nQ continued to host his BBC 1Xtra show \u2013 by now a weekly broadcast - throughout his mainstream success, and frequently appeared on sister station BBC Radio 1 for guest mixes, before his departure in 2012 after 8 years at the station. He soon began a new monthly show on Ministry of Sound Radio, presenting the Essential Garage show.Recent years have seen an increase in new productions from Q, with over 10 digital single and EP releases since 2012 that cross a broad spectrum of dance music. These include \"Say to You\" (released under the alias Classified), the Sound Boy Connection EP via US label Party Like Us, and three singles from his debut album via Local Action Records.During his years in the music industry, Q has also played music in countries across the globe and Europe particularly, with sets in places such as Ibiza, Amsterdam, Italy, Russia, Australia and the United States.\n",

He intended to resigned on 10 March 1997, after four Venezuelan bankrobbers had escaped from the Koraal Specht prison. A week before three convicted murders also managed to escape. However, Prime Minister Pourier wished that he would continue as Minister. Atacho stayed on and starting later that month Dutch Marines had to assist with keeping prisoners inside the prison terrain. A parliamentary report on the state of the prison system led to Atacho's resignation on 24 March 1998.During his political career Atacho helped form six cabinets. In 2002 Atacho was informateur and formateur for the first cabinet of Prime Minister Etienne Ys. He also helped to form the second cabinet of Ys in 2004.

He was Speaker from 5 October 2007 to 22 September 2010.

At age 5, Xana took violin lessons, and at 10, she took vocal lessons.\nIn 2015, Xana formed an acoustic pop-punk duo, Coffee Eyes, with Joel Cossette. When the duo broke up, Xana took at two-year educational program, during which time she avoided writing. In 2018, two months after her program ended, she went to work in order to later make music a financially viable career. She wrote what was to be her third solo single, \"Tipsy\", during the gap between school and work. She continued to write music for the next two years, although she would only begin recording in 2020.Xana debuted solo with the single \"Goddess\" in 2020. The song serves as a statement as to who she is as an artist and the space she'll take up in the industry. Asked why the song uses male pronouns, despite Xana identifying as a lesbian, Xana explained that \"the song speaks to many different situations, personal or otherwise. It was a fuck-you to those people who think they can walk all over you and take whatever they want. With everything that I was dealing with personally and seeing around me in the music industry, the use of \u201che\u201d pronouns reflected those experiences.\" Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which struck right before her planned debut, Xana primarily promoted her music through TikTok.Xana subsequently released singles \"Pray\", \"Tipsy\", \"Yellow\", and \"Kitchen Light\".Xana worked with the indie band Cold Fame on their debut single \u201ctuesday.\u201d which was released on November 23, 2021.Xana released her debut album, \"Tantrums\", on April 15, 2022. The album is autobiographical, reflecting on Xana's experiences in a toxic relationship. The title reflects how, through her music, Xana is \"throwing tantrums so other people don't have to.\" There has been positive reception to the album, with Xtra Magazine citing the opening track as one of \"the best queer songs of April\" and \"the perfect song to throw up two middle fingers to after the end of a relationship gone awry\".The songs \"Yellow\", \"Kitchen Light\", and \"19\" from \"Tantrums\", as well as the single \"Tipsy\", have music videos featuring the character Jodie, who is inspired by a woman with whom Xana had a relationship, and who was important to Xana's personal \"life and \"journey\". Excluding \"Tipsy\", all the videos star Maia Cervillin as Jodie; the actor was changed after \"Tipsy\" due to the on-screen chemistry with Maia. The music video for \"Kitchen Light\" gained over one million views on YouTube.In November 2022, Xana released an acoustic single, \"bet you'll get off on this.\" The song was written over two days and recorded over three. In 2023, she released single \"Bad Bandit,\" a Western-themed track with \"splashes of country twang.\"\nXana identifies as queer and lesbian.\n",

The Internet became a more commercial entity interconnecting a rapidly-increasing number of networks, hosts and users, and as the World Wide Web expanded, the nature of the traffic on the Internet changed. This inspired Claffy to develop initiatives that share Internet data and support Internet data analysis.\nClaffy was promoted to associate research scientist in 1994 and research scientist in 2007. In 1996 Claffy founded the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) in the supercomputing centre at the University of California, San Diego. At the CAIDA Claffy works on internet cartography that characterises the changing nature of Internet topology and Internet traffic dynamics. This involves mapping and measuring internet data in an effort to make the internet safer for the general public.

Upon hearing the trumpet played, he chose it as his instrument. Beal's grandmother, Irene Beal, was an accomplished pianist, professional silent-movie accompanist, and fan of trumpeter Miles Davis. She gave Jeff a recording of Miles' collaboration with Gil Evans, Sketches of Spain. Beal wrote his first long-form composition for the Oakland Youth Symphony Orchestra while a student at Castro Valley High School.  OYSO conductor Kent Nagano had Jeff combine his love of jazz improvisation with an orchestral accompaniment. This merging of improvisation with classical composition has remained a hallmark of Beal's music. Beal went on to study composition and trumpet at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, and graduated in 1985 with a Bachelor of Music degree.\nBeal married a fellow Eastman graduate, soprano Joan (Sapiro) Beal, and the pair moved from Rochester to New York City. It was there Beal composed and recorded his debut album, Liberation, for Island Records. Beal's jazz band went on to perform at The Blue Note and the Montreux Jazz Festival. At the request of Chick Corea, Beal composed and recorded a concerto for the virtuosic jazz bassist, John Patitucci, for Corea's Stretch Records label. Beal's signature work, Alternate Route, was composed for improvised trumpet and orchestra. Written fifteen years after his first long form composition, this piece was again premiered by Kent Nagano and the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra, with Beal as trumpet soloist.  He has also composed improvisatory concerti for Dave Samuels, Larry Coombs, and Turtle Island String Quartet.\nBeal disclosed that in 2007 he was diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis.  Beal attributes the stabilization of the disease symptoms in part to his busy schedule and the concentration required to compose, as well as treating his MS as a vascular disease with lifestyle intervention and venoplasty treatment.\n",

The family moved from Manchester to Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, when he was an infant. He attended Woking Grammar School followed by a sixth-form college. Later, Read worked as an estate agent, and recorded under various names, including Mickey Manchester.\nRead's professional broadcasting career began in March 1976 at Reading's Radio 210, where he co-hosted a slot with Steve Wright \u2013 entitled Read and Wright \u2013 before joining Radio Luxembourg late in 1977. Read joined Radio 1 in November 1978 and was soon presenting the night-time programme before the slot fronted by John Peel; here, Read championed new groups and featured live sessions. On 5 January 1981, he took over Radio 1 Breakfast.\nOn 11 January 1984, Read suddenly interrupted broadcasting the Frankie Goes to Hollywood song \"Relax\", halfway through playing the single, denouncing the lyrics as 'obscene'. Read has said this account of his intervention is a myth; the interruption of the record was solely for timing reasons, as he only had access in the studio to the longer 12\" version. The BBC had already decided to ban the record from Top of the Pops, even though it subsequently reached No. 1 in the UK singles chart.Following on from his five-year stint on Radio 1's breakfast slot, Read took over a Sunday morning programme in 1986. A year later, he moved to Saturday mornings, and also to a Sunday afternoon series, where he played classic tracks. In addition, he hosted Round Table and later went back to it as the renamed Singled Out on Friday evenings, in which musicians and disc jockeys would review new single releases.\nRead's Saturday morning slot ended in September 1988, and his Sunday afternoon oldies series finished in January 1989, when Alan Freeman re-joined the station to host an oldies version of Pick of the Pops, which Read covered in November that year when Freeman was ill. From January 1989 to September 1990, Read presented a weekly series, The Mike Read Collection, (which was broadcast on Monday evenings) and remained on the Friday panel show Singled Out (which by then had gone back to its original name of Round Table); he remained in this slot until 1991.\n",

While in Germany Coates experienced events leading up the fall of the Iron Curtain and the impact of those changes. Upon returning from Europe, Coates began living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.Coates met artist Al Loving during the late 1980s, through his (now) wife Kiki Nienaber. He was working primarily as a figurative painter and Loving encouraged Coates to extend his practice into assemblage. Coates credits this as a breakthrough that allowed him to embrace the physical aspect of painting and to mature as an artist.Then during the late 1990s Coates took an artist residency in Cape Town, South Africa. In 1996 Coates experienced aftermath of the official end of apartheid and encountered extreme poverty, which resulted in another shift in his work via the use of repurposed materials. He saw this as a moral imperative in response the gross wastefulness of industrialized societies and the economic inequities he witnessed while living in Cape Town.  As a result, Coates began using almost exclusively, recycled materials to create his work. Materials used included feathers, bike tubes, cardboard, crumpled papers, dirt, vinyl records, and the heads of push brooms, which he pairs with provocative titles to address topics such as the problematics of Cold-War politics, poverty, racism, domestic labor, and Black aesthetics.\n",

From 1986 to 1990 he studied at the Bergen Conservatory of Music (now known as the Grieg Academy) and at the University of Bergen. From 1990 to 1994 he worked at the Bergen Conservatory as a teacher of contemporary classical music. Furthermore, he was leader of the Autunnale-festivalen - (Music Factory and Autunnale), also in Bergen. In 1992 and 1993 he arranged and composed for the Forsvarets Stabsmusikkorps Vestlandet - Norwegian Army Band, Bergen (NABB), writing, among other works, Arctic Landscape. In this period Aagaard-Nilsen wrote many works for wind band and brass band.Aagaard-Nilsen works as conductor of various school and amateur orchestras, and also as a teacher at the Manger Folkeh\u00f8gskule. He founded the forum Av garde together with Ketil Hvoslef, Jostein Stalheim and Knut Vaage.\nAs a composer he has written for orchestra, chamber ensemble, choir, wind band and brass band. Works that exemplify Aagard-Nilsen's focus on narrative and visual aspects in a nearly impulsive form include Fabula I and Fabula II (1996), Sinfonietta (1998) and The Season of Blue Lights (2008) commissioned by BIT20 Ensemble. A stronger focus on expressive elements in Aagard-Nilsen's output is evident in works such as Pierrot's Lament (Concerto for Euphonium and Orchestra), premiered in 2001 with the Lahti Symphony Orchestra. The trumpet concerto Blue Phrases (2007), the sinfonietta The Season of Blue Light and quartet Blue Fragments (2008) are additional examples of Aagard-Nilsen's expressive focus; while the orchestral work Boreas Sings (2012) represents a new direction in which a spectrum of colours and dancing rhythms become evident. 2014 saw his orchestral work Boreas Bl\u00e6s (2014) premiered by the Norwegian Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra at the opening ceremony of Stormen, Bod\u00f8's concert hall.In 2016 Aagard-Nilsen received the Norwegian Music Publishing Association's Annual Award for his work Dirty Dancing, commissioned and premiered by the Christiania Bl\u00e5seensemble in 2015.\n",

Since he has been in The Mad Capsule Markets, his style of bass guitar playing has evolved into more than the straight punk bass he used to play. From 1996, when lead guitarist Ai Ishigaki left, Takeshi's bass became the main centerpiece of the band and was more experimental in its use, as he experimented by tuning down his bass to give it more of a Rap-Metal effect. By the time of the Digidogheadlock and OSC-DIS albums, he had mastered the guitar and synthesizer (although it is stated that he probably played most of the piano parts on the early albums), started using many effects pedals, and had a similar sound to Tom Morello's style of guitar playing.\nHe has gone under many pseudonyms, such as Kure Takeshi (his name in Berrie), Kurejii Takeshi, (his name on Humanity), Cra\uffe5 (the name he used from 1991\u20131997), and Takeshi \"\uffe5\" Ueda (on the albums 4 Plugs and Digidogheadlock).

Perhaps his most significant contribution to his alma mater came during this period when he strongly recommended an unknown young coach at Army \u2013 Mike Krzyzewski or Coach K \u2013 for the Duke head coaching job. Ironically, Vacendak also played a big role in recommending that NC State consider Jim Valvano for their open head coaching job and State hired Jimmy V just nine days after Duke hired Coach K.   After working at Duke, he became the director of athletics and head basketball coach at Winthrop College in Rock Hill, South Carolina.\nFollowing his stint at Winthrop, Vacendak spent three years working at Homeowners Clubs of America, a franchising company in Charlotte, North Carolina.

She earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry (magna cum laude) from Harvard and her Medical degree from Stanford University School of Medicine. Upon completing her medical degree, Wu was trained in internal medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and completed her medical fellowship in oncology and hematology at the Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute.\nIn 2000, Wu joined the Dana-Farber faculty and began her independent research program in 2005.In 2011, Wu was the recipient of a Stand Up To Cancer Innovative Research Grant for her project \"Coupled Genetic and Functional Dissection of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.\" Using this grant, she identified mutations in the splicing factor SF3B1 connected to the development of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). The following year, Wu continued to lead studies on clonal heterogeneity and clonal evolution of CLL and was subsequently elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation. Wu later led a study analyzing genetic material in CLL and normal tissue of over 500 patients. Her research team identified numerous genetic abnormalities that had the ability to drive leukemia, including RPS15 and IKZF3 which had never before been linked to human cancer.In 2019, Wu continued her research on patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and led a research study which collaborated with scientists at the Broad Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the University of Washington. They found that genetic changes that occur very early in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia development directly influenced the growth pattern the CLL cells would ultimately take. As a result of her research, she was elected a Member of the National Academy of Medicine. Wu later led a study which uncovered why some patients become resistant to Venclexta, a Leukemia drug. Her research team used leukemia samples from before treatment with venetoclax and following their resistance. They then analyzed the tissue looking for genomic differences in the before and after relapse samples. The results of the analysis were lacking so they performed a large-scale loss-of-function screen to see the effect on other genes. Through this screening, they found that resistant cells make too much MCL1. Using a similar approach, Wu also studies how to implement personalized cancer vaccines by identifying neoantigen targets created by a patient's tumor. This immunotherapeutic effort is applicable to blood and solid tumor malignancies.\n\n\n== References ==\n",

The family relocated to Kansas City, drawn there in large part by the city's jazz history. During his Kansas City years, even before reaching his teens, Eldar already started building a reputation as a child prodigy, appearing on Marian McPartland's NPR show, Piano Jazz, when he was only 12 years old, being the youngest performer to appear on her show. Eldar attended Interlochen Center for the Arts in his young teenage years. Eldar attended St. Elizabeth's grade school and the Barstow School in Kansas City. Eventually, the family moved to San Diego where he attended the Francis W. Parker School (San Diego), and then to the Los Angeles area where he attended University of Southern California's Thornton School of Music. Eldar's playing style is characterized by prodigious technique and musicality. Downbeat noted in a review by Bob Doerschuk: \"his command of the instrument is beyond staggering.\"  He was signed to Sony Music at 18 and released 5 albums.  One of the albums was nominated for a Grammy.  Eldar has extensively toured throughout Europe, Asia and North America.\nEldar has been variously compared to Art Tatum, Oscar Peterson, Herbie Hancock and more; yet he also seems to absorb harmonic expansiveness from McCoy Tyner and at times the lyrical sensitivity from Bill Evans.

They lived in Madras (Chennai), and Trichonopoly (Trichy), both in Tamil Nadu.\nJillian started ballet dancing at six years old, and took lessons wherever the family lived. Jillian\u2019s conversion to ballroom dancing came quite late (in dance terms). It occurred when she went on her own to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) when she was 16. She went there to live at the Bradley School of Dancing, for ballet training.\nIt was there she met, Melville Franck\u00e9 (1928-2020), known as Mel, who taught her her first ballroom steps.  She partnered him in many an Amateur Ballroom competition in Colombo and they had many successes.  Later she met Freda Newell-Jones, and continued learning Ballroom & Latin dancing. Her first ballroom medals were taken in Sri Lanka in 1952.\nAs La Valette took lessons towards becoming a dance teacher with the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD), an opportunity came to dance as a professional competitor. James Arnell, who won the 1954 International Amateur Latin American championship with Estrella Pescador, wanted to turn professional.  His partner was unwilling to do this, so a search began to find him a new partner. Although he was 15 years older than Jillian, they became partners for competition Latin dancing. One factor was height: at over 6ft, he was taller than the average Latin dancer, and so was she. Also, they were both being coached by the same school, that of Monsieur Pierre, in Soho. Pierre had been instrumental in setting up Latin American dance in England, and both the teaching syllabus and the competitions were greatly influenced by him.Jillian is qualified as a Fellow of the ISTD in both Ballroom ('Modern') and Latin American dances. She worked as a dance teacher from 1952\u20141971 in studios run by her mentor, Freda Newell-Jones, and until the present day as an independent teacher.\n",

He first entered the entertainment business in the late 1970s as an actor with Shuji Terayama's theatrical group Tenj\u014d Sajiki.His film debut was in the 1981 Genji Nakamura pink film Semi Documentary: Housewife Prostitution Team aka Document Porno: Married Woman Prostitution Techniques. In contrast to his stage career, in his screen work, Ikejima has stayed in the erotic genres. Between 1981 and 1988 he appeared in over 500 softcore pink films, working for such directors as Hisayasu Sat\u014d, Y\u014djir\u014d Takita and Ry\u016bichi Hiroki. Ikejima appeared in Sat\u014d's gay-themed Temptation of the Mask (1987), a film significant for joining three of the \"Four Devils\" or \"Four Heavenly Kings of Pink\" (\u30d4\u30f3\u30af\u56db\u5929\u738b, pinku shitenno) in one work. Ikejima became one of Zeze Takahisa's \"Zeze-gumi\" (Zeze-group) of regulars including Takeshi It\u014d, Y\u014dta Kawase and Yumeka Sasaki. Though most awarded and recognized as a director, Ikejima has continued acting to the present day.He began his directorial career in 1988, at first working mainly in AVs (adult videos). His cinematic theatrical debut as a director was The Masturbating Lesbian (\u30b6\u30fb\uff2f\uff2e\uff21\uff2e\uff29\uff25\u30ec\u30ba, Za Onanie Rezu) (1991). Through his production company Cement Match, Ikejima both stages plays and self-produces film. Cement Match has made films for all of the major pink film distribution companies, but most often produces for OP Eiga. Through this company he has produced such prominent pink films as Daisuke Goto's A Lonely Cow Weeps at Dawn (2003) and ENK's The Gays in Wonderland (1997). Also active in gay-themed films in both acting and directing careers, the 1996 gay film, Love Me Danger, directed by Ikejima, was chosen the 6th Best Film at the Pink Grand Prix. His Men Who Love (2002) was one of the first pink films to be shown at the Tokyo International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival.In his pink film directorial career, Ikejima usually collaborates with his wife, screenwriter Ky\u014dko Godai, who had previously made a name for herself scripting for Hisayasu Sat\u014d. Known for his professionalism and efficiency, when the original pink film version of The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai went over-budget and behind schedule (because of its ambition and precarious production history, Jasper Sharp characterizes it as the Apocalypse Now of the pink film world), Ikejima was called in to film a temporary replacement, a task he accomplished in a few days. In 2008 Ikejima directed his 100th pink film, an accomplishment for which he was given a special award at the Pink Grand Prix.\n",

Her knowledge of the Yup'ik language and culture came from her father and mother, Upayuilnguq and Narullgiar, and her community. Her parents were strict, and an arranged marriage was a distinct possibility for Meade, one which she was against.Meade attended the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. In 1970, she was chosen by the community to teach the first bilingual program in the village of Nunapiciaq in conjunction with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. She already spoke Yup'ik fluently, but had to learn to read and write in Yup'ik, which she learned at the Alaska Native Language Institute in Fairbanks. She taught for a year and then moved on to work at the Yup'ik Language Workshop, where she was involved in creating curriculum for Yup'ik language instruction.Meade met her husband in Fairbanks where he was stationed with the United States Army. They moved to Bethel, where Meade taught Yup'ik at the Kushokwim Community College. She and her husband had two sons together, and it was while she was raising her children that she \"discovered the positive energy of Yup'ik dance--much of which had been stamped out by missionaries in the 1960s.\" She has three grown sons and many grandchildren.Meade was the replacement speaker at an international conference in Fairbanks taking place in 1990. The anthropologist, Ann Fienup-Riordan, was in attendance and the meeting started \"two decades of partnership in the documentation of the Yup'ik culture, language and practices.\"Along with Fienup-Riordan, she has worked on cultural exhibits, identified Yup'ik artifacts in Berlin which were collected from Alaska in 1883 and worked on translations together. Mead and Fienup-Riordan created the show, \"Agayuliyaraput,\" a display of Yup'ik masks. The exhibition opened in 1997 in Toksook Bay, and was shown in Anchorage, New York, Washington, D.C., and Seattle. For the work on the Berlin artifacts in the Ethnologisches Museum, Meade translated conversations of Yup'ik elders and worked on a book, Ciuliamta Aklui, Things of Our Ancestors, which documents the art and the words of the Yup'ik elders. Her transcription was described by Arctic as \"absolutely excellent, as is the translation: it is literal enough to be helpful in understanding the Yup'ik but free enough to present the substance of the elders' speech without eclipsing their eloquence.\"Meade received the Governor's Award for Distinguished Humanities Educator in 2002.

In 2002, he was a featured performer at the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics, and earned numerous awards during his time in Utah, including \"Best Singer and Songwriter\" by Salt Lake City Weekly and \"Best New Artist\" by Indie Review Monthly. The Utah native also composed and performed the theme song to the Emmy Award-winning PBS movie \"The Shadow of Light\", as well as other independent films.\nUtley released his first-ever nationally distributed album Runaway on Kolob Records in November 2005 and a remix EP entitled Hold You + Remixes was released in April 2006, which included a live version of the title track recorded at the Javitz Center in New York City. After publicly breaking ties with the LDS Church and sending his own \"self-excommunication letter\", Justin became a noted activist and advocate for civil rights and LGBT equality in the United States, and an outspoken personality against the LDS church's use of conversion therapy, a method Utley endured for two years after serving a two-year full-time mission for the church. In June 2010, Utley released Stand for Something \u2013 a single written to inspire and motivate to take action towards securing LGBT equality in America, ending youth homelessness, and increasing community awareness. The single was nominated by the LGBT Academy Of Recording Arts for 4 OutMusic Awards, including Best Songwriter and Artist of the Year, winning Best Country/Folk Song of the Year. Another version of the single was released in October 2010 which included two additional live tracks and an acoustic version of songs from the album 'Runaway'.\nTheatrically, his credits include a seven-month Utah regional run as \"Joseph\" in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (2001\u20132002) and as leading man \"Radames\" in the Utah premiere of Elton John and Tim Rice's Broadway hit Aida (2005). Later, he would leave his Mormon-inherited religion behind, relocate to Manhattan and debut in the New York City theater scene as \"Tommy Dautry\" in the musical 'Our Country' (2009).

According to some sources, during this period he was part of the far-left Confederation of Anarcho-Syndicalists.At the beginning of 2000 he joined the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova. In 2001-2002 he was a Member of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova, giving up his mandate to become adviser to President Vladimir Voronin in domestic policy, a position he had held until November 2008. During this period he became one of the leaders of the Communist Party, working on the modernization of the party. He is believed to have negotiated the accession of the PCRM to the Party of the European Left. The opposition criticized him for his strong pro-Russian, Moldovenist, anti-European and anti-Romanian position, characterizing him as \"Moscow's right hand man\".In 2005 and 2006, VIP Magazine included mark Tkaciuk in the top \"most influential Moldovans\" at 11 and 6, respectively.After 2009, when the PCRM entered the opposition, Mark Tkaciuk started to support more strongly a party reform.

Recently, she obtained a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and World Literature at Peking University, with \"Chinese Science Fiction and Its Cultural Politics Since 1990\" as the topic of her dissertation. She now teaches at School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University.During her collegiate life she began to write science fiction works and took part in student clubs for science fiction and fantasy fans. Her short stories have attracted critical acclaim from the outset, beginning with her early Chinese Galaxy Award recipient \"Guan Yaojing de Pingzi\" \u5173\u5996\u7cbe\u7684\u74f6\u5b50 (April 2004 Science Fiction World trans Linda Rui Feng as \"The Demon-Enslaving Flask\" November 2012 Renditions). A work of Fabulation, in which the Scientist James Clerk Maxwell (1831\u20131879) is offered a Faustian challenge by a literal demon, its selection was attended by a spat among critics as to whether it could be called sf at all. The story is mired so deeply in anecdotes from the history of science, and literal interpretations of famous thought experiments, that it requires copious footnotes to explain its own jokes (infodump). This, however, seems very much in keeping with the classical, didactic tradition in Chinese sf, creating a story whose fantasy elements are mere vectors to convey information about the life and work of icon figures such as Archimedes, Albert Einstein, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and Maxwell himself.Later work mirrored her personal academic journey from hard science into the creative arts. Her first longer work was  \"Jiuzhou Nil\u00fc\" \u4e5d\u5dde\u2022\u9006\u65c5 \"On the Road: Odyssey of China Fantasy\" (coll of linked stories 2009), part of the Jiuzhou shared-universe fantasy series. \"Bai Gui Ye Xing Jie\" \u767e\u9b3c\u591c\u884c\u8857 (August 2010  Science Fiction World trans Ken Liu as \"A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight\" February 2012 Clarkesworld) is far subtler and more mature, a child's eye view of life inside what first appears to be a haunted Keep redolent of Chinese ghost stories, but is gradually revealed as a run-down Far Future theme park populated with Cyborg simulacra.

After a short successful run, the band broke up due to creative differences, and Juan Son became a solo act. He has stated in interviews that being in Porter had become less inspiring to him and he felt restricted as far as the kind of music he was expected to create.His first album, Mermaid Sashimi (2009), won him a Latin Grammy nomination. Mermaid Sashimi not only showcases his ability to sing but his ability as a storyteller as well. Juan Son uses techniques such as sound sampling, voice effects, wordless chanting, and writing in three different languages. The vocal effects recreate the imagined sounds of mermaids throughout his recording. According to him, the nature of the English language gives a sense of coldness and practicality, while the Spanish verses add warmth and romance.In 2010, he moved to New York, where he made the acquaintance of many leading figures in music, such as Bjork and Blonde Redhead.

She later decided to remain in Algiers after finishing her studies.She then worked in advertising and at the same time wrote short stories, which she would use a few years later to create her short film: Softly One Saturday Morning, the story of a rapist without an erection.\nSoftly One Saturday Morning was released in 2012 and it was met with positive reception. It won two awards at the Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival, the ACSE and the Best First Fictional Film.   This film was also presented at the Malm\u00f6 Arab Film Festival in Sweden, the Journ\u00e9es Cin\u00e9matographiques in Algier and at other various short film festivals around the world.\nIn 2017, Djama released a full-length feature film, The Blessed. This film follows the lives of characters living in Algiers post-civil war. The film also shows a dilemma faced by many Algerians during this post-war period: whether to piece back together life in Algeria or to relocate to France in hopes to start fresh. Djama received two awards for this film at the Venice Film Festival. The first one, the Brian Award, is given to a film that defends the values of human rights, democracy, diversity and freedom of thought, without distinction for gender or sexual orientation. Djama was also awarded the Lina Mangiacapre Award, which is given to a film which changes the representation and image of women in cinema.In January 2018, Djama, with her film The Blessed, participated in the 19th Black Movie Festival in Geneva, Switzerland, where she received the Public Award.\nIn 2015, Djama supported a young woman who was denied access to University for a skirt that was deemed too short.

He missed two tournaments from injury in July and September 1989 which saw him fall from the makushita division to the sandanme division, but upon his return he rose steadily up makushita and was promoted to sekitori status in November 1991 upon reaching the juryo division.

She completed her PhD in mathematics education at the same university and won the award for best PhD in education from the British Educational Research Association in 1997.\nDuring the early part of Boaler's career, she conducted longitudinal studies of students learning mathematics through different approaches. Her first three-year study in England was published as \"Experiencing School Mathematics: Teaching Styles, Sex, and Setting.\"In 1998, Boaler became an Assistant Professor of Mathematics Education at Stanford University in the Graduate School of Education. She became an associate professor in 2000 and left as a full professor in 2006. From 2000 to 2004, Boaler served as the president of the International Organization of Women and Mathematics Education.In 2000, she was awarded a presidential Early Career Award from the National Science Foundation. \nThe NSF funded study would come to be known as the Railside study. This was a longitudinal study across three schools in northern California. The goal of the study was to compare the impact of traditional math curriculum and the reform curriculum developed by Boaler. A key distinction between the two approaches was that the traditional approach allowed students to take algebra in 8th grade, whereas algebra was delayed until 9th grade in the reform curriculum. Preliminary findings for the study were released in 2005. The findings were promising and were used to support further reform efforts.Believing the preliminary results \"too good to be true\", Stanford mathematician R. James Milgram, CSULA professor Wayne Bishop, and statistician Paul Clopton investigated Boaler's claims and published a 20-page report writing that Boaler's claims were exaggerated. In 2005, Milgram formally charged Boaler with scientific misconduct with Stanford. Stanford's preliminary investigation concluded by acknowledging ongoing debates in mathematics education and absolving Boaler of scientific misconduct stating that the allegations \"do not have substance\".\n",

Yoder's dissertation was titled Species interactions and the origins of biological diversity. He completed a postdoc at University of Minnesota with Peter Tiffin. Yoder conducted further postdoctoral studies at University of British Columbia under Sally Aitken.\nYoder is an evolutionary biologist, science communicator and LGBTQIA+ advocate. He joined California State University, Northridge as an assistant professor of biology in 2017. Yoder studies \"coevolution and the population genomics of local adaptation, particularly in mutualisms.\" He researches how the ecological impacts of different climates, biological communities, and habitats relate to biodiversity by conducting field studies and using mathematical modelling and population genomic data. Through the analysis of a global database, Yoder and his colleagues have studied pollination interactions of zygomorphic flowers. He discovers that plants with zygomorphic flowers have fewer visitor species possibly because of their manipulations of pollinator behaviors. His finding suggests that plant taxa with zygomorphic flowers are more susceptible to extinction due to pollinator loss.  In 2013, Yoder collaborated with Allison Mattheis on research investigating the experiences of LGBTQIA+ identifying individuals in STEM. He is a collaborator with the Joshua Tree Genome Project and the Queer in STEM study of LGBTQ experiences in scientific careers. He has written for the website of Scientific American, the LA Review of Books, the Chronicle of Higher Education, The Awl, and Slate.\nYoder identifies as gay.

In 1956, following a leg break, Yeats had a trial with Elgin City, then a Highland League club, but was not offered a contract. In 1957 he was signed by Dundee United, then a part-time club of Scottish Division Two. Previous to signing for the club, he worked in a slaughter house in Aberdeen.\nYeats's career took an upward turn following Jerry Kerr's appointment: Kerr regarded Yeats as so vital to the fortunes of the team he sought his release to play each Saturday from the military authorities while Yeats served his National Service. In 1959\u201360, Kerr's first full season in charge, St Johnstone finished as Division Two champions. United's challengers for the second promotion spot were Hamilton Academical and Queen of the South. Hamilton were beaten 5\u20131 at Tannadice with seven games to go before a crowd of over 11,000, putting Hamilton firmly in United's rear view. United went to Palmerston Park to play the Ivor Broadis inspired Queen of the South with three games to go. United returned home with a 4\u20134 draw to maintain their one-point advantage over QoS. Promotion was clinched with a last game of the season 1\u20130 home win against Berwick Rangers before a crowd of near 17,000. This brought top division football back to Tannadice Park for the first time since they had been relegated in 1932.In the following 1960\u201361 season, United retained their top division place, finishing in ninth. Other players to flourish like Yeats were the forward pair Dennis Gillespie and Jim Irvine. Yeats played 118 matches (95 in the league) for Dundee United.\nIn 1976 at age 38, he joined the Los Angeles Skyhawks of the American Soccer League at the request of Skyhawk coach Ron Newman. In his only season there, he played sweeper and anchored the defence of the A.S.L. champion Skyhawks.\nIn 1977, he became the player coach of the American Soccer League's Santa Barbara Condors expansion team.\n",

He completed two undergraduate degrees, one in theology, from the University of Pretoria, where he was a member of the national executive of the Afrikaanse Studentebond from 1965 to 1967. After graduating, he was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church, first in Magaliesburg and then in Springs.In 1974, de Beer was elected to a National Party (NP) seat in the House of Assembly, representing the Transvaal's Geduld constituency. He served in Parliament for the next two decades. After chairing the East Rand branch of the NP from 1983 to 1984, he was Deputy Minister of Education and Development Aid from 1984 to 1989. In 1991, President F. W. de Klerk appointed him to the cabinet as Minister for Education and Training, a portfolio which included administration of the Bantu education system.\nThe 1994 general election was held under universal suffrage and de Beer was elected to represent the NP in the new multi-racial National Assembly. During the legislative term that followed, in June 1997, he was elected to succeed Roelf Meyer as leader of the NP's Gauteng provincial branch, narrowly defeating Fanus Schoeman. When de Klerk resigned as the party's national leader weeks later, de Beer ran to succeed him in a contest against Danie Schutte and Marthinus van Schalkwyk; van Schalkwyk prevailed, but de Beer retained his position as Gauteng leader.\nIn August 1998, de Beer resigned as NP provincial leader and as a Member of Parliament in order to defect from the NP (by then restyled as the New National Party) to the United Democratic Movement (UDM). He appeared on the UDM's party list in the 1999 general election and was returned to a seat in the National Assembly. However, he again failed to complete his term in the seat: in February 2001, he announced that he had resigned from the UDM, and would therefore lose his parliamentary seat. He said:[The] optimistic expectations that I had of the UDM's potential of achieving its goals, as expressed in its election manifesto, have faded away. Under these circumstances it is only fair to make room for somebody who can still work with enthusiasm for the party. I see the last two and a half years involvement in establishing a new, young party \u2013 with its main aim to bring all South Africans together in one party \u2013 as a privilege and a great experience.He also accused Roelf Meyer, the UDM's co-founder and his former NP colleague, of having abandoned the UDM, saying \"It could have been a totally different sorry if Roelf had not done that\". De Beer subsequently joined the governing African National Congress (ANC), and in mid-March he was sworn in to an ANC seat in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. He was re-elected to a full term in the provincial legislature in the 2004 general election.\n",

The elder of two siblings, he has a younger sister. As a child, RM largely learned English by watching the American sitcom Friends with his mother. As a student, he actively wrote poetry and often received awards for his writing. He posted his work to an online poetry website for roughly one year, where he received moderate attention. As a result, RM expressed interest in pursuing a literary career but later decided against it. When he was twelve years old, he studied in New Zealand for four months.At age 11, in fifth grade, RM became interested in hip-hop music after hearing Epik High's \"Fly\". Finding that the song had provided him comfort, he decided to look further into the genre. He was introduced to the music of American rapper Eminem by his school teacher, which first sparked RM's interest in lyricism. He would print out lyrics that he felt were \"cool\" and shared them with friends. RM began songwriting at that time, stating that his poetry became lyrics when it combined with music. In 2007, as a first-year middle school student, he began rapping in local amateur hip-hop circles, creating his first self-composed recording with the program Adobe Audition (then called Cool Edit) and later participating in his first concert in 2008. RM became more active in the underground Korean hip-hop scene under the moniker Runch Randa, releasing a number of tracks and collaborations with other underground rappers such as Zico.As a student, RM had an IQ of 148 and scored in the top 1% of the nation in the university entrance examinations for language, math, foreign language and social studies. Because his parents had been strongly opposed to his interest in a musical career due to his academic achievements, RM initially decided to set music aside to focus on his studies. He eventually convinced his mother to allow him to be a rapper, asking her if \"she wanted to have a son who was a first-place rapper, or a 5,000th-place student\".In March 2019, after graduating from Global Cyber University with a degree in Broadcasting and Entertainment, RM enrolled at Hanyang Cyber University's Master of Business Administration program in Advertising and Media.\nRM underwent septoplasty for his nasal septum deviation in 2018 and temporarily withdrew from band activities while recovering from the operation.Since 2018, RM has lived in Hannam-dong, Seoul, South Korea with his bandmates. In November 2019, he bought a property in the Yongsan District of Seoul for \u20a94.9 billion, then sold it the following year for \u20a95.8 billion.

She was approached to work on the Japanese role-playing game Romancing SaGa by a representative from Square Co. (now Square Enix) following the release of a book for her illustration collection. Development of Romancing SaGa had Kobayashi create concept art for characters before the in-game character designs were made, due to the game having stories and concepts for its characters created in advance. She was given only a profile for each character that was about two paragraphs in length and told to use her imagination. Sprite designer Kazuko Shibuya came to visit Kobayashi to look at and talk about Kobayashi's art with her before bringing it back to the team to show them. The camaraderie the two had made caused Shibuya to feel more attached to Kobayashi's work. This method of illustration differs from her work illustrating concepts for characters in novels, where she reads the text of the novel first. Kobayashi described this method as \"half-terrifying and half-exhilarating.\" The work proved more difficult for Kobayashi than expected due to the larger volume of characters she was expected to design for the project. She approximated 5 to 6 main characters and \"at most\" 10 minor characters to draw for a novel, whereas the number in Romancing SaGa was \"triple or quadruple\" that, with the sequel Romancing SaGa 2 having even more characters for her to design. When designing for Romancing SaGa 2, Kobayashi aimed to change things with her approach, but felt that the outcome was largely the same. For Romancing SaGa 3, she designed the characters to come from different parts of the world based the character's names rather than any design description.Kobayashi has done work to promote the SaGa series, such as during an event celebrating the series' 25th anniversary in the Saga Prefecture where her designs were on display in an art gallery. These designs were featured on porcelain plates (a process called \"Arita-yaki\") among other things, which were either used as presentation for the event or sold.\n",

He formally studied music at the Berlin University of the Arts, intending originally to become a baritone opera singer. He and eleven other students formed the Palast Orchester in 1985.  The ensemble initially used music arrangements that Raabe found at various flea markets.  The orchestra practised these arrangements for one year without any public engagements or performances. The orchestra first performed publicly at the 1987 Berliner Theaterball, in the lobby as a secondary act, but with such success that the audience left the ballroom to hear the orchestra's performance in the lobby. Raabe and the Palast Orchester had a hit with his 1992 original, Schlager-styled song \"Kein Schwein ruft mich an\" (\"Nobody ever calls me\", almost literal translation: \"No pig calls me\"), a pop song in 1920s style.\nIn addition to covers of vintage music, Raabe writes original songs and music, including film music.  He and the orchestra have also created covers of modern pop songs in a 1920\u20131930s band style, including songs by Britney Spears, Tom Jones, and Salt'n'Pepa. Raabe has also made a number of cameo appearances as a stereotypical 1920s and 1930s singer and entertainer in a number of films by German directors, such as Der bewegte Mann (1994; English title \"Maybe, Maybe Not\"), Werner Herzog's Invincible (2001), and Wenzel Storch's Die Reise ins Gl\u00fcck (2004). His live theatre performances have included a 1994 appearance as Dr. Siedler in the Berlin \"Bar jeder Vernunft\" version of The White Horse Inn, and 1999 performances as Mack the Knife in Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht's The Threepenny Opera alongside Nina Hagen.\nRaabe first performed in the USA in Los Angeles in 2004. In 2005, he performed his first concert in New York City's Carnegie Hall and returned for subsequent engagements with the Palast Orchester in 2007 and 2010. In 2011, Raabe produced an album, K\u00fcssen kann man nicht alleine (You cannot kiss alone), with former new-wave musician and producer Annette Humpe, who also wrote the lyrics. His latest album, also with Humpe, is F\u00fcr Frauen ist das kein Problem (\"It's no problem for women\"), released in 2013.\nIn 2022, Raabe made an appearance as himself in the 1920s neo-noir series Babylon Berlin, in which he performed a single titled Ein Tag wie Gold.\n",

Kubicka said that he had landed it in the short program but it was not filmed so he did it again in the long. Next year, he won silver at the U.S. Championships and competed at the World Championships again.\nIn 1976, he won the U.S. national title, landing five triple jumps in the long program and landing his first back flip.  He was named to the American team for the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, where he became the first and only skater to perform a legal backflip; it was banned after the competition.

He studied Politics and Sociology at the University of Warwick.\nHe married his wife Kashmir, a lawyer, on 17 November 1991 in Derby. They have three children together. He holds a season ticket for Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club, and is a trustee of the second largest Gurudwara (Sikh Temple) in Wolverhampton.\nUppal was selected as Conservative Party candidate for Birmingham Yardley less than three months before the 2005 general election. The seat was traditionally a Conservative-Labour Party marginal, but became a three-way marginal at the 1992 general election and a Labour-Liberal Democrat marginal since the 1997 general election, with the Conservatives pushed into an increasingly distant third place. Uppal came third in 2005, winning 2,970 votes, with Liberal Democrat John Hemming replacing the retiring Labour MP Estelle Morris.\nIn February 2007, Uppal was selected as the Wolverhampton South West Conservative candidate in an open primary held at Molineux Stadium, in which all constituents were entitled to vote. The seat had once been a safe Conservative seat, held first by Enoch Powell from 1950 to 1974 and then by Nicholas Budgen, but became a Labour marginal, held by Jenny Jones in 1997. Rob Marris held it from 2001 onwards, though the Labour majorities gradually reduced at each election, Uppal won the seat from the incumbent Labour MP Rob Marris with 16,344 votes and a majority of 691.In July 2010, he was elected Chairman of the All Party Urban Development Group. In October 2011, he voted against a referendum on the UK's membership of European Union. In September 2012, he was appointed PPS to David Willetts at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.\nIn the run up to the 2015 general election, both Uppal, his main opponent Marris, and even UKIP agreed that immigration was no longer a key issue in the seat which was once held by the controversial MP Enoch Powell. Uppal highlighted the improvement in community relations whilst Marris expressed concern about zero-hour contracts, foodbanks and workers earning less than a living wage.Uppal was narrowly defeated at the 2015 general election, when Marris regained the seat with a majority of 801. Uppal stood as a candidate in the same seat at the 2017 snap general election and despite increasing his party's vote share by 3%, the Labour vote increased by 6.1%, and Uppal consequently lost by 2,185 votes.\n",

After making his Real Sociedad first-team debut during the 2004\u201305 season, he achieved notoriety as a result of a lawsuit in which his first club prevented him from playing for Athletic Bilbao for 14 months, due to an alleged illegality in his transfer between the two Basque sides.Zubiaurre, who represented Real Sociedad at youth level, was 'presented' as new Athletic Bilbao player in 2005 by the latter's president Fernando Lamikiz, despite still being under contract. He had no permission to rescind his link, which had a year left to run and a buy-out clause of \u20ac33 million (the former club had activated a one-season optional extension to his contract, while the latter asserted that he was a free agent). Real insisted that Athletic pay the entire amount, with the player not being allowed to play professional football during the subsequent legal battle; SCD Durango, a regional club, asked permission to field him, but were denied.Fifteen months after the lawsuit began, a judge ruled that Athletic had to pay Real Sociedad \u20ac5 million, and were granted permission to field Zubiaurre for the 2006\u201307 campaign. He was presented for a second time at San Mam\u00e9s Stadium on 16 November 2006, and was given the number 12 shirt.On 11 February 2007, Zubiaurre played his first La Liga match for Athletic, appearing against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid as a substitute in a 1\u20130 away defeat. That was to be his only game of the season, in which his team avoided relegation on the very last matchday.\nZubiaurre also only featured once in 2007\u201308, in a 2\u20130 loss at Getafe CF on 31 October 2007. After almost two years in the sidelines, he left in order to gain more playing time, joining Segunda Divisi\u00f3n side Elche CF on a season-long loan.Returned to Athletic for the 2009\u201310 campaign, Zubiaurre's season input consisted of 15 minutes against FK Austria Wien (3\u20130 win at home) in the UEFA Europa League group stage. In July 2010 another loan ensued, also in the second tier, as he signed with Albacete Balompi\u00e9.Zubiaurre was deemed surplus to requirements in 2011\u201312 after the appointment of manager Marcelo Bielsa, alongside teammates Koikili and Aitor Ocio. He remained with the team, however.Zubiaurre was loaned to UD Salamanca in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B for the 2012\u201313 season. He moved to Racing de Santander in August 2013, being waived after only one month and no matches played.\n",

The party exited the race in a distant fourth place, a margin that, while small, still permitted it one constituent in the incoming assembly.As a constituent, Ojopi pushed for the codification of departmental autonomy for Pando and the other eight departments, a primary policy priority articulated by most conservative currents opposed to the ruling Movement for Socialism (MAS-IPSP). Additionally, Ojopi was one of several opposition constituents who vocalized their rejection of the Constituent Assembly as a stage for \"folkloric\" representation. For figures like Ojopi, the assembly was \"serious business\", where slogans of constitutional representation for indigenous peoples, the peasantry, and \"those carrying feathers, ponchos, and arrows\" had no place. Even after the passage of the 2009 Constitution, Ojopi continued to qualify legislation such as that that required all public officials to speak two State recognized languages as \"absurd\": \"Spanish is the language in which we all understand each other ... everyone speaks Spanish ... I cannot understand ... those who speak Aymara and Quechua ... if I speak Cavine\u00f1o, who is going to understand me?\".Upon the conclusion of his term in the Constituent Assembly, Ojopi continued to operate in Pando politics. In 2010, he sought the Cobija mayoralty as part of an alliance between the MNR and Popular Consensus (CP). Although CP saw a wide array of victories in nine of Pando's fifteen municipalities, Ojopi narrowly failed to win the capital, being defeated by Ana Luc\u00eda Reis, a former MNR partisan who had switched allegiances to the MAS.\n",

She spent most of her teenage years working for her parents, who also worked in the cosmetics industry as wholesalers. She attended Glendale Community College on the weekends, and operated the business with her parents during the week, but eventually dropped out to work for her parents as a manager of their wholesale business full-time.\nWith her prior experience in cosmetics, Toni sought to fill a gap in the market for lower-priced, high-quality makeup products. In 1999, Ko founded NYX Cosmetics, being given $250,000 in startup money from her mother. The company was named after the Greek goddess Nyx.Her original goal was to \u201c... make a department store product with the price point of a drugstore product.\u201d The company earned $4 million in its first year.The first NYX Cosmetics line consisted of six eye and twelve lip liners, which were priced at $1.99 each in comparison to their competitors whose prices hovered around the $10 mark.Her high-quality, low-price approach fulfilled a developing consumer need after increased demand due to the financial crisis of 2008. She also increased the company\u2019s sales during the advent of the vlog on Youtube by partnering with trending beauty creators on the platform. This unconventional marketing approach formulated a strong brand that appealed to a younger audience and set the company up for a potential buyout.In 2014, Ko sold NYX Cosmetics to L'Or\u00e9al for an estimated $500 million.\nDue to a non-compete clause with L'Or\u00e9al, Ko could not launch another cosmetics company during the five years following the buyout. In March 2016, Ko created the Perverse Sunglasses company, launching as a sponsor of Coachella. Ko changed the brand's name to Thomas James LA.

In 1985, after Hu Jintao was promoted to party chief of Guizhou, he was made Secretary of the Guizhou Communist Youth League. As part of his mandate in 1992, he traveled to Northwest China to find out why some young people were religious, and to try to convert them to the Youth League instead. The reflective article he wrote earned him the attention of religious and Communist Party leaders in China.The article criticized the Communist Party leadership as regarding religion as \"backward and fatuous\", and for simply hoping that young people would become atheists. It acknowledged that religion \"has mass appeal and is going to be around for a long time\", and that it is \"compatible with a socialist society.\" He condemned the anti-religious excesses of the Cultural Revolution, and recommended that China loosen its grip on religion as part of the reform and opening up. On the other hand, Ye vindicates the CPC's suspicions about foreign missionaries in Europe's colonial past with China, and religion's role in overthrowing communist states in the Revolutions of 1989. Therefore, he argues, the state must stress \"self-governance, self-support, and self-sufficiency\" in Chinese religious organizations. This greatly influenced Chinese paramount leader Jiang Zemin's reformist attitudes on religion, which were attacked on both the CPC right and left for being too restrictive or not restrictive enough. Ye later reflected that he had to quote Karl Marx on religion in order for the CPC members to listen to his ideas.\n",

From there, he worked at Chicago's WGN-TV for five years (which included national exposure on WGN's superstation feed), and then at WMAQ-TV; he also taught meteorology classes at Columbia College Chicago.\nHe moved south to Mobile in 1999, where he joined WKRG-TV. He teaches weather broadcasting at the University of South Alabama each spring, according to the news station's website. In addition, he has produced over four dozen weather videos for schools, distributed throughout North America.In 2017, a segment of Sealls updating viewers on Hurricane Irma went viral on social media, topping the front page of Reddit and becoming the third most trending clip on YouTube. A number of commenters praised Sealls' calm, patient demeanor, likening his delivery to Bob Ross or Mr. Rogers. The clips attracted news coverage from The Washington Post. For Sealls, the moment was gratifying: \"It was amazing that something that I\u2019ve always done, the exact same way, suddenly went viral. It was a positive thing, because most things that start trending on the internet are, in my opinion, either goofy or silly or somehow embarrassing \u2013 things that don\u2019t necessarily have value in the long run. But this is one where people got excited about science, they got excited about learning, so to me, that was a really wonderful thing.\"In 2019, he parted ways with WKRG after being unable to negotiate a contract renewal. Sealls confirmed he plans to \"remain active both in the community and as a meteorologist.\"It was announced on November 19, 2019 that Alan would be returning to the airwaves starting in January 2020 on WPMI-TV.\n",

In 1955, young Carl took advantage of the temporary political thaw following Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, obtained a one-month visa to West Germany and biked there, then decided to stay when he learned there that his application to Humboldt University (in East Berlin) for the study of chemistry had been turned down (because of his poor performance in mathematics).

Two years later, he met and fell in love with Otto's niece, Matilda Friedrich, the daughter of Carl Friedrich, the political scientist and constitutional scholar.

He practiced law for several years before deciding to go into politics, at which time he considered running for the Ohio General Assembly, but was convinced to run for Toledo City Council. During his tenure on City Council, he was frequently at odds with Toledo's outspoken Democratic mayor, Carty Finkbeiner. Most notably, after a dispute over an eminent domain issue, Mayor Finkbeiner referred to him as \"a demagogue and obstructionist of the highest order\".Zmuda remained on City Council until Governor Bob Taft appointed him to a vacant seat on the Toledo Municipal Court in 2003. His peers on the court elected him the presiding Judge, and he remained at that post until the election of Tom Osowik to an appellate court created a vacancy on the Lucas County Common Pleas Court. Taft then appointed Zmuda to fill this seat.The tenure of Municipal Court Judge Zmuda is perhaps best known for his striking down of a law banning the transportation of alcohol into Ohio from other states. Judge Zmuda opined that the application of the law was unconstitutional because it violated the interstate commerce clause of the United States Constitution. This was effectively seen as a victory for local college students who had made a habit of bringing beer kegs over the nearby Michigan border.\nIn 2006, Zmuda was elected board President of the newly formed University of Toledo Honors Alumni Affiliate.\n\n\n== References ==\n",

However, after an argument with his mother, a mathematics teacher, he applied to study medicine, and was accepted by University of New South Wales.  As an undergraduate he met James W. Lance and became interested in the area of experimental science applied to neurology, especially migraine.\nGoadsby's research has focused on headaches, trying to understand their mechanisms and how to provide better treatments. His work has especially addressed the causes of migraine and cluster headaches. His research led him to hypothesise that migraine might not be a vascular disease, as was then accepted, or psychosomatic and caused by stress. Instead, he and colleagues developed evidence that it had a nerve-based mechanism that resulted in the pain and other symptoms.Their work in the 1980s led to the discovery of the mechanism that starts a migraine, involved the calcitonin gene-related peptide, CGRP, a peptide involved in neuronal communication. This provided a new target for drugs, namely those that could interfere with the interaction of CGRP and its receptor. As a result, the gepants such as atogepant have been developed and introduced to clinical use. He was also part of a group that in a clinical trial over six months showed, for the first time, that a monoclonal antibody could significantly reduce frequency and effects of migraine. Several have been introduced into clinical use for those with chronic migraine. Erenumab was approved for use in the USA (in 2018), Scotland from 2019, England (from 2021), and other countries.\nHe trained in neurophysiology with David Burke. He subsequently trained, worked and studied with Don Reis at Cornell, USA; Jacques Seylaz at Universite VII, Paris, and post-graduate neurology training at the Institute of Neurology, London with C David Marsden, Andrew Lees, Anita Harding and W Ian McDonald. He later returned to Australia. He joined the University of New South Wales and became a consultant neurologist at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney. He was later appointed a Wellcome Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Neurology and Professor of Clinical Neurology and Honorary Consultant Neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London until 2007.Goadsby was Professor of Neurology, at University of California, San Francisco, 2007-2013. He is also an Honorary Consultant Neurologist at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, UK and Professor of Neurology, University of California, Los Angeles.\n",
