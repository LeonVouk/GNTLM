There she and her husband William Weber (Bill) worked in a small boarding school in rural south central Zaire. She taught the girls there by reminding them \"You're special -- don't ever forget that\". One day they asked her why she changed her name to her husband's if she believed everyone was special. She then decided to change her last name from Weber back to Vedder upon returning to the United States. Her time in Zaire inspired her interest in wildlife conservation. This feeling intensified at Zaire's Kahuzi-Biega National Park where she observed Casimir, an enormous male eastern lowland gorilla. This encounter made her want to work with wildlife in Africa after the Peace Corps.\nIn 1975, Vedder returned to the United States where she began searching for a graduate school where they could launch her career in wildlife conservation. She and Bill chose the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. From one of their graduate program's classmates, the couple learned about British primatologist Richard Wrangham who recently visited Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park. In October 1977 they met Dian Fossey in Chicago, where she accepted their research proposal and set a tentative date for their arrival in Rwanda.\nIn 1978 she arrived in Rwanda with her husband to study gorillas at Karisoke, the research station run by Fossey. They arrived right after poachers has killed a mountain gorilla named Digit who was famous due to Fossey's research. The couple had secured research funding from the Wildlife Conservation Society. There she tried to nurse a wounded gorilla named Mweza back to health but did not succeed. This experience left her and Bill angry. With that anger, they chose to focus on ways to help the gorilla population. Amy followed Gorilla Group 5 and wrote down everything they ate and where. This information helped her figure out the type of habitat and how much the gorillas needed. After six weeks of following the group, the gorillas started to accept her presence for longer periods of time. She took notes on a specific gorilla in the group each day, noting how often and what the gorilla ate.\nAfter getting a doctorate at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1989, she became Biodiversity Coordinator for the Wildlife Conservation Society, and later director of the conservation of the society's Africa Program.\nOne of Vedder's contributions was to implement the Mountain Gorilla Project (subsequently the International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP)), which sought to involve local Rwandans and use ecotourism to help conserve the gorillas.\n",

Her role went largely unnoticed due to the film being based around Arjun's action image, with a critic labelling her performance as \"adequate\". After the release of Madrasi, Vedhika went on to sign a big budget Hindi language film, Jai Santoshi Maa, a remake of the 1975 film of the same name, but the film failed to subsequently materialize and Vedhika continued acting in South Indian films. She went on to feature in Raghava Lawrence's comedy horror Muni, but her role was minimal once again and the film went to become an average grosser commercially. Her maiden Telugu venture was in Vijayadasami, a remake of the Tamil film Sivakasi, where her performance was described as \"okay\" and \"average\" by critics.Her first release in 2008, the Silambarasan-starrer Kaalai, received negative reviews and became a commercial failure. However, the film became notable for the dance number, \"Kutti Pisase\" with Vedhika's dancing being critically appreciated. She went on to appear in a second successive film which was panned by critics and which became a financial failure with a role in Sakkarakatti. The long-delayed film featured Shanthnoo Bhagyaraj making his debut in the lead role and A. R. Rahman providing the soundtrack, however Vedhika's role was described as one of the sole positives from the project.

The film had little scope for Vedhika and reviews cited her role as \"pure eye candy\" whilst claiming she was \"apt\" for the role.

Her role won her plaudits, whilst her on screen presence with Nara Rohit was praised with a critic citing she gives \"good company as the na\u00efve girl\" and it is \"refreshing to see them together\".

Back in France, she danced with Fran\u00e7ois Raffinot from 1991 to 1996. In 1997, she founded the Sui Generis company. She was noticed early on for her distinctive style.\nIn 1999, she was awarded a Villa Medicis Hors-les murs grant for her research in creating Texture/Composite, for which she was awarded the Prix d\u2019Auteur at the Rencontres chor\u00e9graphiques internationales de Bagnolet in 2000. The piece was subsequently presented at Danspace Project in New York in 2002. Since then her productions have been presented on a regular basis both in France and abroad. In January 2012, Vo-Dinh became the director of Le Phare, Centre Chor\u00e9graphique National du Havre Haute-Normandie, ushering in a new artistic vision that has reached out to a diversity of choreographic styles.\nVo-Dinh's wide-ranging choreography has been shaped through the process of creating new work. While she initially focused on choreographing in a more formal way, her methodology gradually evolved toward an open-ended process affording a prominent role to improvisation in the studio. Surrounded by close collaborators, Vo-Dinh works with her performers on a long-term basis.\nSeveral pieces have been deeply rooted in scientific and anthropological research on human beings, romantic relationships, absence, the lack of emotion and schizophrenia. The art world has also informed her work: between figurative and abstract in the visual arts, as well as in the relationship between bodies in motion and the music of Beethoven, Dusapin, Zeena Parkins or G\u00e9rard Grisey. Although the choreographic structure often draws on minimalism to the point of repeating and transforming a single motif, Vo-Dinh has mainly focused on time, how it is perceived and its relationship to memory and memories. After a long absence, fragmented narration has surfaced in her latest pieces \u2013 a new approach to time and point of view, as well as to the body and how it relates to others.\nVo-Dinh readily accepts invitations, including Rainbow, her piece for amateur dancers in collaboration with David Monceau, and her work with the writer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mauche for Concordanse. Beginning with Histoires Exquises in 2011, she has invited choreographers to create solos from oral testimonies, the starting point for opening up the creative process to audiences. That willingness to share and her curiosity about other approaches to dance were to be the leitmotif in her vision for the CCN du Havre. Since 2012, Vo-Dinh has endeavored to make Le Phare a platform for many different kinds of choreography \u2013 during key moments such as the Pharenheit festival, as well as throughout the year, bringing the CCN to life in order to showcase dance in all it vibrancy.\nSince 2014, she has been the president of the Association des Centres Chor\u00e9graphiques Nationaux, a network comprising nineteen national choreographic centers in France. Vo-Dinh was awarded the insignia of Chevalier de l\u2019ordre des Arts et des Lettres in July 2014.\n",

Although it may be argued that a major methodological interest of the Baroque hypothesis lies in its very imprecision, his book, \u00c9pist\u00e9m\u00e8 baroque: le mot et la chose (Hermann, 2013) provides a new theory for a concept which JC Vuillemin associates with the epistemological breakdown Europe experienced in the wake of the emergence of Modern science. As a conceptual framework in which poetics, politics, and epistemology interact, his conception of the Baroque is much less aesthetic than purposefully philosophical. According to JC Vuillemin, Sapere aude  ('dare to know') should be the motto of the Baroque.\nJC Vuillemin collaborated to the first critical edition of Jean Rotrou\u2019s complete theater (Belles-Lettres / Sorbonne-Paris-4, 1998-2019) and he published in 2017 an on-going annotated digital bibliography: Jean de Rotrou: bibliographie critique [1]. Vuillemin collaborated as well to the first Dictionary of Seventeenth-Century French Philosophers (Thoemmes Press / CNRS; trans. for Classiques Garnier). In addition to his book on Baroque episteme, he wrote one book on Rotrou\u2019s dramaturgy (Baroquisme et th\u00e9\u00e2tralit\u00e9), three critical editions of Rotrou's plays (L\u2019Hypocondriaque; L\u2019Innocente Infid\u00e9lit\u00e9; La Belle Alphr\u00e8de), and he has authored many articles, book chapters, and reviews. He frequently lectures on both sides of the Atlantic. In his latest book, Foucault l'intempestif (Hermann, 2019), JC Vuillemin revisits and clarifies some key concepts of the so-called \"pens\u00e9e Foucault,\" and pleads for the emergence of a \"post-Cartesian\" subject whose discourse (logos) will be congruent with his or her actions (ergon).\n",

At 17 he signed professional forms for Wolverhampton Wanderers, but was unable to break through to the first team, and in 1970 moved back home to join Darlington in the Fourth Division. After 18 months he was transferred to Second Division side Hull City. He established himself as first choice goalkeeper a year later, and starting from the 1973\u201374 season missed only three games in four years. Injury restricted his appearances in the next season, when Hull were relegated to the Third Division.In July 1979 Wealands joined Birmingham City, then in the Second Division, for a fee of \u00a330,000. His first season at Birmingham saw them promoted to the First Division. He kept 16 clean sheets and was chosen Player of the Year. He kept his place as first choice goalkeeper, despite competition from promising youngster Tony Coton, and played more than 100 games before a difference of views with new manager Ron Saunders saw him out of contention. He joined Manchester United as cover for Gary Bailey, initially on loan, in 1983, and was an unused substitute in the 1983 FA Charity Shield, but a recurring back injury restricted his chances. Periods on loan at Oldham Athletic and Preston North End preceded his leaving the Football League altogether to join Altrincham in the Alliance Premier League (soon to be renamed the Football Conference).Wealands' first season at Altrincham brought considerable success, culminating in a trip to Wembley where the club beat Runcorn 1\u20130 to win the 1985\u201386 FA Trophy. In that season's FA Cup, Altrincham reached the Third Round and were drawn away to Birmingham City, still in the First Division and still managed by Saunders. Wealands helped his new club become only the second non-league team to eliminate top-flight opponents on their own ground when they won 2\u20131, a result which gave the player considerable personal satisfaction, and which was followed two days later by Saunders' resignation. The next season Wealands helped the club reach the final of the Cheshire Senior Cup. He then had a spell at Barrow before returning to Altrincham in 1988. The last of his 273 games in all competitions for the club was in 1992, by which time he was 41 years old.After finally retiring from playing, he served briefly on the board of Altrincham, and has coached goalkeepers at Bury. In his early days with Altrincham he worked in insurance, and later was involved with a property development company.\n",

The Bakersfield paintings marked the first time she incorporated illuminated neon light tubes into her abstract paintings. The series was inspired by the colourful neon signs she saw on old restaurant and factory buildings while driving around Bakersfield.Weatherford used neon in the Bakersfield Project and later series of paintings, such as Manhattan (2013), Los Angeles (2014) and Train Yard (2016\u20132020) to recreate the sensations of specific places or moments.

Her early research, published in Nature, was one of the first studies to show that fog, in addition to rain, can contribute to acid pollution to forests.\nWeathers is an ecosystem ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, where she has spent most of her research career. Her research interests are broad and she has made significant contributions to our understanding of atmospheric ecology, terrestrial ecology, and aquatic ecology. To date, Weathers has written or contributed to over 200 peer-reviewed articles, which have received over 13,000 citations. Her research is focused on understanding of how air-water-land interactions affect ecosystem functioning. For example, she has worked with colleagues to quantify how fog and precipitation can both provide critical nutrients to forest ecosystems, but also harmful pollutants. Other notable research has studied the effects of storms on lake water quality and coupled human-ecosystem interactions.She is the lead editor of the foundational textbook Fundamentals of Ecosystem Science with David Strayer and Gene Likens. In addition to co-authoring the textbook, Weathers has led multiple synthesis efforts in ecosystem science, including setting a research agenda for the discipline.Weathers has taken many leadership roles within the ecological community that have informed policy. Weathers is the current (elected) President of the Ecological Society of America (2020-2021) and was the elected Chair of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (2011-2012).

Weathers' training model is to explicitly empower early career scientists to take leadership roles in collaborative research projects. Under Weathers' guidance, early career GLEON researchers have led many collaborative projects, including studies on how road salt and climate change affect lakes.In addition to leading international research networks and scientific societies, Weathers is the Research Director of the Lake Sunapee Protective Association, where she facilitates scientific engagement between the public and researchers. As part of this role, Weathers has catalyzed multiple research studies on Lake Sunapee, which has led to new understanding on the sensitivity of low-nutrient lakes to land use change and cyanobacterial blooms.

He graduated in 1968 with an M.F.A. degree in industrial design and worked for the next two years at UNITRA, Warsaw, designing popular electronic products. From 1970 until his emigration to Canada in 1977, he designed professional optical, mechanical, and electronic instruments at the Polish Optical Works.In 1969, Wodiczko collaborated with Andrzej Dluzniewski and Wojciech Wybieralski on a design proposal for a memorial to victims of Majdanek concentration camp in Poland. He also performed with Personal Instrument in the streets of Warsaw and participated in the Biennale de Paris as a leader of a group architectural project. He was a teaching assistant for two years, 1969\u201370, in the Basic Design Program at the Academy of Fine Arts before moving to the Warsaw Polytechnic Institute, where he taught until 1976. Throughout the 1970s he continued his collaborations on sound and music performances with various musicians and artists.\nIn 1971, Wodiczko began work on Vehicle, which he tested the following year on the streets of Warsaw. In 1972 he created his first solo installation: Corridor at Galeria Wspolczesna, Warsaw. The following year he began exhibiting with Galeria Foksal, Warsaw. In 1975, Wodiczko traveled for the first time to the United States where he was artist-in-residence at the University of Illinois, Urbana and exhibited at N.A.M.E. Gallery, Chicago.

Moving from graffiti art to the studio in 2000 Woehr started to experiment with painting on canvas and constructing sculptural dioramas. Working in these modes of expression Woehr sought to capture the dynamism of the urban experience and environment. Recognized for his artistic talent in 2010 Woehr was chosen, along with four other artists, to represent Germany in the Fine Art international art exhibition, an arts initiative and traveling exhibition created to celebrate the FIFA World Cup of the same year.\nIn 2013 Woehr sought new means to treat the city, his urban subject matter. His abstract images depict a bird's eye view, a vision which represents the fundamental essence of an urban experience Woehr eschews realistic depictions, alternatively restructuring and reshaping the streets and architecture of a particular city he has visited in a style reminiscent of the Russian Constructivists, like Kazimir Malevich, El Lissitzky, Vladimir Tatlin and the artists of the Bauhaus such as L\u00e1szlo Moholy-Nagy, from whom he draws inspiration. By titling each work with a location's geographic or GPS coordinates, Woehr invites viewer participation, research and exploration of the subject city. While each work is a translation of the artist's personal connection with a particular city, the receding dimensionality of each multi-layer image leaves the viewer a conceptual space for her own interpretation. Although he works primarily in the studio, Woehr remains close to the urban landscape continuing to paint outside on city walls, buildings, trains and large-scale sculptures. These works achieve the same objectives as his sculptural reliefs, as he crafts the illusion of the three-dimensional space in these painted constructions. Painted on a monumental scale this work envelops the viewer, inviting her into a newly conceived urban environment and experience.\n",

At a young age, her family moved to the village of Balzers in Liechtenstein. Wohlwend grew up in Balzers, and later attended the Liechtenstein Gymnasium in Vaduz, where she graduated in 1998. Later that year, she began attending the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, graduating in 2002 with a degree in forensic science.In 2002, Wohlwend began working at the Federal Criminal Police Office in Wiesbaden, Germany. She initially worked in the field of forensic technology, specifically ballistics and crime scene reconstruction. Among her duties, Wohlwend prepared a report for the 14th Interpol Forensic Science Symposium. She later switched her field to quality management and compliance, and left the police in 2007.\nWohlwend moved back to Liechtenstein in 2008, becoming the head of the business controlling and services department of Kyberna AG, an IT company in Vaduz. She was named to the company's executive board in 2011, and was \"responsible for data protection and data location issues\". In 2012, Wohlwend received a master's degree in controlling from the Zurich University of Economics. The following year, she co-founded a consulting firm in Balzers named Elleta AG. Wohlwend is the firm's managing director, focusing on \"risk management, data protection, information security and compliance\", and she sits on the company's board of directors. In 2020, she won the Business Day Award at the \"13th Women's Business Day in Vaduz\".In the 2013 Liechtenstein general election, Wohlwend was elected to the Landtag of Liechtenstein, representing Oberland as a member of the Progressive Citizens' Party (FBP). Following her election, Wohlwend became the FBP's parliamentary group spokeswoman, thus becoming an ex officio member of the party's presidium. During her tenure in parliament, Wohlwend supported legislation which would give government employees the same protections against dismissal as private sector employees, \"strengthen government oversight of public companies\", and launch a \"review of subsidies and transfer payments to private individuals\". Wohlwend left office at the end of her term in 2017.Since 2018, Wohlwend has been the president of the board of directors of Liechtensteiner Volksblatt AG, the managing company of Liechtensteiner Volksblatt, one of Liechtenstein's two daily newspapers. In February 2023, she announced that the newspaper would cease publication in March due to declining subscriptions and rising costs.\n\n\n== References ==\n",

The following year, Wu continued to lead studies on clonal heterogeneity and clonal evolution of CLL and was subsequently elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation. Wu later led a study analyzing genetic material in CLL and normal tissue of over 500 patients. Her research team identified numerous genetic abnormalities that had the ability to drive leukemia, including RPS15 and IKZF3 which had never before been linked to human cancer.In 2019, Wu continued her research on patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and led a research study which collaborated with scientists at the Broad Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the University of Washington. They found that genetic changes that occur very early in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia development directly influenced the growth pattern the CLL cells would ultimately take. As a result of her research, she was elected a Member of the National Academy of Medicine. Wu later led a study which uncovered why some patients become resistant to Venclexta, a Leukemia drug. Her research team used leukemia samples from before treatment with venetoclax and following their resistance. They then analyzed the tissue looking for genomic differences in the before and after relapse samples. The results of the analysis were lacking so they performed a large-scale loss-of-function screen to see the effect on other genes. Through this screening, they found that resistant cells make too much MCL1. Using a similar approach, Wu also studies how to implement personalized cancer vaccines by identifying neoantigen targets created by a patient's tumor.

She then entered the Film Studies Program at the Communication University of China, where she completed her Master's thesis: \"A Study on Female Figures in Science Fiction Films\". Recently, she obtained a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and World Literature at Peking University, with \"Chinese Science Fiction and Its Cultural Politics Since 1990\" as the topic of her dissertation. She now teaches at School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Xi'an Jiaotong University.During her collegiate life she began to write science fiction works and took part in student clubs for science fiction and fantasy fans. Her short stories have attracted critical acclaim from the outset, beginning with her early Chinese Galaxy Award recipient \"Guan Yaojing de Pingzi\" \u5173\u5996\u7cbe\u7684\u74f6\u5b50 (April 2004 Science Fiction World trans Linda Rui Feng as \"The Demon-Enslaving Flask\" November 2012 Renditions). A work of Fabulation, in which the Scientist James Clerk Maxwell (1831\u20131879) is offered a Faustian challenge by a literal demon, its selection was attended by a spat among critics as to whether it could be called sf at all. The story is mired so deeply in anecdotes from the history of science, and literal interpretations of famous thought experiments, that it requires copious footnotes to explain its own jokes (infodump). This, however, seems very much in keeping with the classical, didactic tradition in Chinese sf, creating a story whose fantasy elements are mere vectors to convey information about the life and work of icon figures such as Archimedes, Albert Einstein, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and Maxwell himself.Later work mirrored her personal academic journey from hard science into the creative arts. Her first longer work was  \"Jiuzhou Nil\u00fc\" \u4e5d\u5dde\u2022\u9006\u65c5 \"On the Road: Odyssey of China Fantasy\" (coll of linked stories 2009), part of the Jiuzhou shared-universe fantasy series. \"Bai Gui Ye Xing Jie\" \u767e\u9b3c\u591c\u884c\u8857 (August 2010  Science Fiction World trans Ken Liu as \"A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight\" February 2012 Clarkesworld) is far subtler and more mature, a child's eye view of life inside what first appears to be a haunted Keep redolent of Chinese ghost stories, but is gradually revealed as a run-down Far Future theme park populated with Cyborg simulacra.

From 1988 to 1990, Xia was an assistant professor at Harvard University and from 1990 to 1994, an associate professor at Georgia Institute of Technology (and Institute Fellow). In 1994, he became a full professor at Northwestern University and since 2000, he has been the Arthur and Gladys Pancoe Professor of Mathematics.His research deals with celestial mechanics, dynamical systems, Hamiltonian dynamics, and ergodic theory. In his dissertation, he solved the Painlev\u00e9 conjecture, a long-standing problem posed in 1895 by Paul Painlev\u00e9. The problem concerns the existence of singularities of non-collision character in the \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  -body problem in three-dimensional space; Xia proved the existence for \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        \u2265\n        5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N\\geq 5}\n  . For the existence proof, he constructed an example of five masses, of which four are separated into two pairs which revolve around each other in eccentric elliptical orbits about the z-axis of symmetry, and a fifth mass moves along the z-axis. For selected initial conditions, the fifth mass can be accelerated to an infinite velocity in a finite time interval (without any collision between the bodies involved in the example).

Xiao's original interest was the Yuan dynasty, but from the mid-1980s he turned his attention to the history of the late Qing and early Republican periods.In his early academic career, Xiao studied the thought of Yan Fu, an influential Chinese scholar and Westerniser of this era, questioning the negative historical reputation that had become attached to Yan because of his later support for conservative projects such as Yuan Shikai's attempted monarchist restoration. Xiao came to the conclusion that Yan was a consistent incremental reformist who had struck a middle course between outright reaction and the wholesale abandonment of China's national identity. Building on his work on Yan, Xiao went on to make a broader reevaluation of the fall of the Qing dynasty, arguing that the Hundred Days' Reform of 1898 failed primarily not because of the conservatism of Cixi but because of the radicalism of Kang Youwei and his allies.\n",

He returned to New York in 2016 to attend Hostos Community College, playing basketball for the school's team, but his interest in music led him to return to Atlanta that same year where the hip hop scene had been heating up with the advent of trap's rise in popularity. The numbers in his name came from his building number in the Bronx, while the letters are his first and last initials.With a few songs under his belt, Rochez realized he needed a way to stand out. He first employed his signature squeaky voice in the 2018 single \"Crack\". The song garnered attention when its video was reposted by fellow New Yorker Lil Tecca, including from the music industry. This led to the release of his self-titled debut album in 2019, and the single \"4 da Trap\" later in the year. \"4 da Trap\" spread virally across the internet, even leading Twitter to suspend 645AR's account because they assumed it was spam. The momentum led the rapper to sign a record deal with Columbia Records.\n",

A1one studied for 5 years at the Faculty of Art and Architecture in one of the Universities in Tehran. While still a student, he began painting graffiti on the walls of his campus, as a protest against students' conditions.  He was eventually expelled by the University's principal following a disagreement over religious restrictions.After being expelled from the University, his graffiti activities in the city of Tehran increased. A1one was the first person to start painting on the city walls. Therefore, his name can be interpreted as \"Alone\" or \"First One\". A1one started painting walls in the late 1990s. He is the pioneer of the urban art scene in the Middle East. When he began, it was a time when nobody knew what graffiti was in his country. He had a very influential role in the rise of street art and stenciling within Iran. Already involved in urban arts in general, he met the rapper, Nima, in 2005, who told him everything about the graffiti culture, which triggered A1one's desire to grow in that direction. His first significant work was a painting under the Tehran-Karaj expressway called Searching for Friends.He started his street art project in 2003 and inspired his close friends at that time to also begin painting on the streets. Artists such as Elle, isba, K.T., and Magoi were the first people to join him in Tehran. With his public space art, he describes his view on Iranian society and puts himself regularly in danger.\n\"When I decided to do my painting on walls I bought some spray cans \u2013 at that time we had just some very low-quality colors in Iran. My first work was a very simple work titled \"searching for friends\" painted on a wall right next to the Tehran-Karaj expressway late at night. It was a frightening night for me\u2026 The next morning I got three calls from friends who recognized my style of painting. They were shocked to see my work on a public wall. My first stencil was a Munch's Scream Print on Art University walls and after that, experimented with many techniques and methods, but I continue with stencils, graffiti, and sticker art.\"\nIn 2007, he was invited to illustrate the cover of a book, Young and Defiant in Iran; a contemporary ethnographic work by Shahram Khosravi. In 2008, he was invited to show his work at the annual Melbourne Stencil Festival, taking 40 pieces of work with him to his first trip in a non-dictatorship country, thus experimenting exhibiting his artwork without the fear of reprisals for the first time.By 2010, A1One was an established name within Tehran's youth culture and a key figure in the emergence of Iranian street art.\n",

Aali held his first solo exhibition, including photographs with new perspectives and compositions, at the Culture Hall in 1963 and has since held several solo and group exhibitions. Having a close relationship with Iranian modernist painters and sculptors, he took a formalistic and modernist look at his work, emphasizing that photography was not a mere copy of reality. One of the significant innovations in Iranian photography was the creation of mosaic combinations of photographs that did not correspond to classical photography methods. He exhibited this collection of his works for the first time in 1968 in Seyhoun Gallery. Another part of his works includes documentary photographs, which simultaneously found a general and human face due to repetition and sequence. After the revolution, he spent more time on his painting experiences, which are generally hyper-realistic, and many of his works were done in the form of paintings on photographs.

According to Aalto, her parents had decided to give her the name Marja-Sisko if she had been born a girl, as they had hoped. She was preoccupied with the issue of gender from the age of three. Although her parents had wanted a girl, they did not accept her gender identity. For example, they were angry when Aalto, as a child, asked why she could not wear a skirt when all the other girls did.Aalto's coming out as a trans woman caused a great controversy in the Church. The bishop of Mikkeli, Voitto Huotari, commented that there is no juridical obstacle for Aalto continuing as a vicar, but predicted that there would be problems. In 2009, almost 600 members left the Imatra parish. In November 2009, Aalto returned to the job of vicar after spending a year on leave. In March 2010, she requested to be allowed to resign, due in part to the discrimination she faced.She was elected the notary of diocese for Kuopio by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in 2010.\nSince her resignation as vicar, Aalto has pursued a career as a writer of detective fiction.

In 1962 Baas started studying biology at Leiden University. In his first year of biology Baas hated plant systematics as he hardly knew any plants or animals. He preferred plant anatomy and physiology. While studying he was offered a job at the Rijksherbarium, the herbarium of Leiden University, by its director Cornelis Gijsbert Gerrit Jan van Steenis. Baas rejected the offer, having no interest in working in a herbarium. For his final year of studying Baas wished to stay at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Van Steenis agreed to this if Baas took up a course of systematics. Between 1968 and 1969 Baas studied at the Royal Botanic Gardens under Professor C.R. Metcalfe. On his return from the United Kingdom Baas approached Van Steenis and asked to be employed as a wood anatomy expert. In 1969 Baas became an employee of the Rijksherbarium.In 1975 Baas earned his PhD in wood anatomy, with a thesis entitled: \"Comparative anatomy of Ilex, Nemopanthus, Sphenostemon, Phelline, and Oncotheca\".

In 1966, Eagar worked for five months taking photos at a children's hospital in Saigon. Eagar particularly liked the photography in Sports Illustrated.\nDuring the 1963 West Indies series in England, Eagar took a photograph of Wes Hall breaking Colin Cowdrey's arm in the Lord's Test match. This was in spite of the fact that the ground did not permit photography. The first Test match where Eagar was an official photographer was the 1965 match at Headingley between England and New Zealand; John Edrich scored a triple century in the match.After a rise in freelance photographers, Eagar began to cover matches on a more frequent basis, beginning with the 1972 Ashes series in England. In the 1972 Headingley Ashes Test, Eagar had just one over to take a photograph for The Sunday Times to use for the next day's newspaper. During the 1970s, he produced photographs for the Wisden Cricket Monthly and The Cricketer magazines.

Robert completed his education at Mohawk College.\nAt age 6, Fab began taking piano lessons, but it wasn't until age 14, when he picked up the guitar, that he first began performing in his band \"The Canadian Museum\" at local high schools and YMCA dances. He spent several years playing in a handful of bands before he became a founding member of \"Buxton Kastle\", his first major group. Signed to RCA Records in 1970 with bandmates Jerry Doucette, Jack Pedler, and David Kastle, the group scored a major hit with the single \"Kagie\", hitting #2 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary chart RPM in 1971.\nWhen Doucette left the group later in 1971, Georgie switched from Hammond CV Organ to guitar. The band then changed labels from RCA to Reprise Records, and then Warner Bros where they again hit the charts with the single \"Red Red The Rocking Horse\", \"Shorty McKenna\", \"Lovin Games\", and \"Love is Life\". It was during this period that Georgie was thrust into the spotlight, appearing on Canadian TV shows such as \"Canadian Bandstand\", \"Musical Friends\", and \"Like Young\", a national musical TV show out of Montreal.\nSoon following the break up of Buxton Kastle, Georgie began his relationship with Skip Prokop, founding member of the Juno award-winning rock orchestra Lighthouse.

The song remained at #1 for the weeks of 2 and 9 May 1981, and earned the boys a BMI award for one of the top ten most played records of the year, and garnered a Gold Record for Pringle. This in turn led to Georgie being approached by Atlantic Records Chairman of the Board, in order to collaborate with Juno Award winner, Kim Mitchell, to write material for his first LP, Akimbo Alogo. The record went platinum and the co-writing efforts produced the Top 40 hit, \"Feel It Burn\", the \"Go For Soda\" B-side entitled \"Caroline\" with Pye Dubois, and the #1 song, \"All We Are.\" Georgie wrote the uncredited lyric hook, \"...you make me feel such a long way away...\"\nBesides being a musician, Georgie is also a record producer and co-founder of the record company \"Race Records\" (), as well as the recording studio \"A cellar full of noise\"\n",

An article on Van Geel, published in the journal Raam attracted attention, and he was invited by the de Volkskrant newspaper to write reviews for them.\nIn 1995, Gaarlandt became the Lord of the Manor of Barendrecht, a purely honorary position without any role of governance. The hereditary title belonged to his uncle, after whose death, he purchased it for 10,000 guilders.\nPreviously, Gaarlandt has also been Mayor of Emmen and a Queen's Commissioner in Drente.\nGaarlandt's early career was as a reviewer of theological works for the de Volkskrant and the Vrij Nederland magazine between 1973-1979, following which he was assigned more and more literary criticism. Over time, he began to lose interest in reviewing Dutch literature. He said, \"My frustration with the quality of the Dutch literature increased more and more. My pieces were increasingly acidic and cynical.\" He responded to an advertisement for an editorship at De Haan and started work there in 1977.  One of his early successes was his discovery of the war diaries of Etty Hillesum in 1981. The diaries described Hillesum's experiences at the Westerbork transit camp. He edited several volumes of the diaries. Subsequently, he was an editor for the ten volume Modern Encyclopedia of World Literature. He also began to translate books from German.\nIn 1986, Gaarlandt founded the non-fiction imprint Balans, which later merged with De Bezige Bij. Balans became established following the successful publication of Hillesum's books; another popular work was the newly translated Bible by Nico ter Linden.

They sought to organize the pictorial surface without using traditional devices.\nAlthough their methods differed greatly, most of the work was monochromatic, geometric, kinetic, and gestural. But most of all they used nontraditional materials such as industrial materials, fire and water, light, and kinetic effects. The influence of the Zero group and the materials they used is clear in Haacke's early work from his paintings that allude to movement and expression to his early installations that are formally minimal and use earthly elements as materials.These early installations focused on systems and processes. Condensation Cube (1963\u201365) embodies a physical occurrence, of the condensation cycle, in real time.

Since 1978 he has been at Yale University, where he is at present J. W. Gibbs professor for physics and chemistry.\nIachello received the Chiaudano prize in 1968  and was a Fulbright Fellow in 1964. He was awarded in 1990 the Wigner Medal, in 1991 both the Taormina Prize and the Dutch AKZO Prize, and in 1993, along with Akito Arima, the Tom W. Bonner Prize of the American Physical Society.

He has honorary doctorates from the University of Ferrara, the University of Seville, and Chung Yuan University in China.\nIachello is famous for the application of algebraic methods (Lie algebras) to the investigation of the spectra of atomic nuclei and molecules. In 1974 with Akito Arima he introduced the \"Interacting Boson Model\" into nuclear physics. This important model describes collective nuclear states with the help of the unitary group U(6). The underlying concept is to derive a model with pairs of neutrons and protons instead of unpaired nucleons. The pairs are treated as bosons with different quantum spin (s- and d- bosons, as named according to spin 0 and 2). In an extension of the model, the analogous effect with unpaired fermions has a description using supersymmetrical algebras.In recent times he has worked mainly on the investigation of the quantum mechanical dynamics of molecules (e.g. quantum phase transitions, polymer dynamics) with algebraic methods, on which Iachello already began to work in 1981 (Vibron Model).\n",

She entered Arizona State University in 2005, with the initial interest of filming and directing or becoming an astronaut but quickly became fascinated by geology. In her sophomore year, she began working for and researching with petrologist Gordon Moore. She then pursued her doctoral degree at the University of Cambridge.\nIacovino's work has involved carefully negotiated diplomatic relations with countries such as North Korea. During one of these trips, she worked alongside a team of their scientists as the only woman involved. She was the first female scientist to ever conduct traveling research in North Korea and was also the only American on this expedition. Iacovino is part of a small group of women in volcanology, but is highly respected for her work ethic and strength.Iacovino's work in North Korea is part of an international effort (which includes American, British, North Korean, and Chinese colleagues) to understand Mount Paektu, an volcano located on the border between North Korea and China. The work is led by British scientists Clive Oppenheimer (Iacovino's PhD supervisor) and James Hammond and was recently featured in the Werner Herzog documentary \"Into the Inferno\". The group's work has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Notably, the publications include both western and North Korean co-authors.In 2012, Iacovino also studied Erta Ale in Ethiopia. During this, her team was the target of a high-profile attempt to capture and imprison Westerners. Due to a delay in traveling, this was not successful - although several other tourists were harmed.Currently, Iacovino is working for NASA. Iacovino was a Post-Doctoral Fellow at Arizona State University. Iacovino previously held a National Science Foundation Post-Doctoral Fellowship at the United States Department of the Interior US Geological Survey. She recreates magma chambers with experimental petrology, characterizes rock samples, measures volcanic degassing, and performs thermodynamic modeling.She has also published articles in scientific journals, lectured at universities such as Arizona State University, and presented around the world. Additionally, she received many research grants, including the AAAS Research Grant most recently.\nIacovino is the Editor-in-Chief of TrekMovie.com, as a longstanding Star Trek fan. She believes that science fiction is a useful tool in helping the public gain interest in science. She was also inspired by  Kate Mulgrew's character - the first female captain of Star Trek. Mulgrew has since met with Iacovino and noted that unlike Iacovino, she \"only played one [scientist] on TV.\"Iacovino is involved in encouraging young women to pursue STEM careers, such as with projects like the Curiosity Science Program created through a Gold Award Project by one of BBC's 100 Women of 2016, Erin McKenney. In this program, Iacovino described her own career as one that requires curiosity, interest in the world, and a willingness to get your hands dirty. In a separate interview, her advice to people interested in volcanology was, \"Follow your heart, and see what path that leads you down and find something that you\u2019re passionate about.\"\n",

You could go to any house and everybody was playing music.\" At fourteen, he began performing professionally with his mother, Tina, and his uncle, the rarely recorded slack-key master Fred Punahoa.\nHis professional breakthrough came a few years later, when he was a part of the Hui 'Ohana (means \"Family Group\"), with his twin brother, Nedward Kaapana, and his cousin, falsetto-great Dennis Pavao. Hui 'Ohana released fourteen albums, each of which was a commercial and critical success.  Kaapana left the group eventually, and then released six albums as the leader of another trio, I Kona, and performed with the Pahinui Brothers, Aunty Genoa Keawe, David Chun, Barney Isaacs, and Uncle Joe Keawe.\nHis first solo album, Lima Wela (means \"Hot Hands\"), was released in 1983; the album won the Na Hoku Hanohano (means \"Honored Stars\") Award for \"Instrumental Album of the Year\" in 1984.

Ledward has played at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C., and made many tours of North America; his fans frequently refer to themselves as \"Led Heads.\"\nKaapana (\"Kah-ah-pah-nah\") spells his name without using the modern  \u02bbokina  marking that is used to indicate a glottal stop for the proper pronunciation of certain Hawaiian words.

Ho and other young ADPL members strongly opposed Fung's intention to run in another Kowloon West by-election, which led to Fung's departure from the party.In the 2020 Legislative Council election, Ho contested in the pro-democracy primaries for the nomination in Kowloon West. Initial results showed Ho came in fifth, which meant he barely lost the nomination to localist camp candidate Frankie Fung. With the paper ballots included, Ho slightly surpassed Fung in the final vote tally, securing a place for ADPL in the general election.On 6 January 2021, Ho was among 53 members of the pro-democratic camp who were arrested under the national security law, specifically its provision regarding alleged subversion. The group stood accused of the organisation of and participation in unofficial primary elections held by the camp in July 2020. Ho was released on bail on 7 January.After he was charged with subversion, together with 47 others, Ho decided to resign as vice-chairman of ADPL on 17 March 2021, and he was replaced by Howard Lee. On 10 July, Ho decided to resign from his position as a councillor of Sham Shui Po District Council on 10 July 2021, citing imminent removal from office under a massive disqualification from the government based on violation of both the Basic Law and the national security law.\n\n\n== References ==\n",

Goodman, Hu explored the role of the plexin receptor and the Rho family GTPases in central nervous system development in Drosophila. Plexins are receptors involved in axon guidance, and Hu discovered a seven amino acid sequence in plexin, PlexB, which is necessary for Rac-GTP binding and subsequently axon guidance. Interestingly, PlexB inhibits Rac from binding downstream interactors while at the same time enhancing RhoA activity, altogether driving axon guidance. In further work, Hu found that CrossGAP, a GTPase-activating protein, is responsible for regulating Rac dependent-cytoskeletal changes during axon guidance in Drosophila. Hu completed her PhD in 2002.Following her PhD, Hu pursued her postdoctoral work under the mentorship of Julius Zhu and Roberto Malinow at the University of Virginia. In 2004, Hu moved to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and then to the University of California, San Diego in 2006, to continue working under the mentorship of Malinow. During her postdoc, Hu explored the role of AMPA receptor trafficking in emotional enhancement of memory formation as well as the role of Ras GTPase signalling in fragile X syndrome.\nIn 2008, Hu returned to China and joined the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai and became the principal investigator of the Hu Lab. Her lab has been focusing on the neural mechanisms of social dominance in mice as well as the neural mechanisms of depression and the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Her lab has pioneered techniques with which to probe the neural correlates of social rank.

Falling in love with photography, she decided to enroll to study it at the London College of Fashion, and it was during her time there that she started to become more concerned about some of the unsettling undertones in fashion imagery, particularly the stereotypes used in the portrayal of non-Western cultures. During her final year she started casting mixed-race models who fell outside the industry norm - something that has become central to her work.\nAfter graduating, Ijewere shunned the conventional career path of starting as a photographer's assistant, as she felt it important to   have the freedom to shoot in ways that would protect her own vision. Instead, she worked for an interior design company, maintaining her photographic passion by spending almost every spare moment and weekend photographing her mixed-raced friends.  By posting her early work on social media, she gradually built up her reputation, leading to professional commissions.Ijewere has worked with a large number of companies with fashion interests, including Dazed, i-D, Stella McCartney, Nike and Gap.

Asked for her thoughts on the Vogue commission, she said, \"I feel like in doing this I'm proving to younger girls from a similar background that it's achievable. It also feels like part of a broader shift within our culture to include far more diversity, both behind the camera and in front of it. As a girl, I never identified with anyone in the pages of magazines. Now, we're sending a message that everyone is welcome in fashion.\"Ijewere does most of her model casting personally, often choosing models who do not conform to conventional industry standards.  She notes, \"I especially like to photograph those from ethnicities that are under-represented. London is such a diverse place and I feel that needs to be reflected within the fashion world.\" She has stated that her work is \"all about the celebration of diversity without creating a representation \u2013 particularly for women, as we are the ones who are more exposed to beauty ideals and to not being comfortable in who we are\".Ijewere's first book is a monograph titled Our Own Selves (2021).\n\n\n== References ==\n",

Ikemoto's friends enjoyed them so much that they started buying stickers from him. By this point of his life, Ikemoto felt he had the talent for art.In March 1997, Mikio Ikemoto submitted his first one-shot manga, titled Cosmos, to the manga magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump, for which he won a Tenkaichi Manga Award. The one-shot was later published in the July 7 issue of the magazine, gaining a small cult following despite its mature subject matter. Cosmos was then serialized in Monthly Plasma, an independent manga magazine, from June 1997 to September 1999, and a sequel one-shot was published in the April 26, 1999 issue of Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump.\nBy this time Ikemoto had become interested in the work of fellow rookie manga artist Masashi Kishimoto. Upon hearing that Ikemoto had been contacted by Shueisha to work as an assistant on a comedy series and was moving to Tokyo, Kishimoto felt that his art would be wasted on that genre. With work beginning on the Naruto serialization, Kishimoto asked his editor, Kosuke Yahagi, to scout Ikemoto and recruit him as an assistant. Ikemoto was grateful for the offer, since he felt that Naruto's genre was what he had originally wanted to work on, and accepted the job, beginning work with the seventh chapter. During the early days of making Naruto, Ikemoto was Kishimoto's youngest assistant, and the latter jokingly said this made him and his other assistants envious. Ikemoto's responsibilities included drawing crowds and background figures, adding white to speed lines, highlights and characters' eyes, whiting out art that went out of the panels, putting stars in night skies, and adding in half-tones. He was also occasionally tasked with creating the designs for new characters. Ikemoto recalls how often Kishimoto requested his help with adding more details to the manga chapters, leading him to draw more clones created by Naruto Uzumaki as well as an unspecified character who could become giant.When the manga ended in 2014, Shueisha asked Kishimoto to start a sequel. However, Kishimoto rejected the idea and proposed that Ikemoto draw it based on the experience he had. Kishimoto advised Ikemoto not to imitate his art style and instead make his own. While noting long-time fans might be disappointed with the fact that Kishimoto is not drawing Boruto, Ikemoto stated he would do his best in the making of the manga. Ikemoto mentioned he remained optimistic about his art style. Kishimoto also revises the manga's scenario. Besides illustrating the manga, Ikemoto also provides illustrations for the Boruto light novels. The manga had one million copies in print as of January 2017 while Studio Pierrot also produced an anime series based on it.\n",

When the Korean War broke out, Jo Jeong-rae and his family evacuated to the South, where he was unpopular with the local children and frequently fought with them, fights he generally lost. He was interested in literature from early in life, and won competitions in elementary school. He majored in Korean literature at Dongguk University, and worked as a high school teacher for several years after graduation. His literary debut was in 1970 when he published the short story \"A False Charge\" (\ub204\uba85), after which he decided to devote his entire life to literature.\nJo Jeong-rae's popular multi-volume novels Taebaek Mountain Range (\ud0dc\ubc31\uc0b0\ub9e5, 1983-1989) and Arirang (\uc544\ub9ac\ub791, 1995), both of which have come to be considered modern classics since their publication in the 1980s, are widely considered to be the epitome of his talent. With the publication of his novel Han River (\ud55c\uac15, 2002), Jo Jeong-rae finally completed his trilogy of works dedicated to modern Korean history. Sales of the series reached record-breaking numbers in South Korea, selling over 10 million copies.The epic historical trilogy, begun in 1983 and eventually completed in 2002, comprises Jo Jeong-rae's three most well-known novels: Taebaek Mountain Range, Arirang, and Han River. Each novel is over ten volumes in length, and each deals with different aspects of the turbulent history of Korea in the modern era. The first novel, Taebaek Mountain Range, examines the five-year period between the liberation of Korea from Japanese colonial rule in 1945 to the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, with detailed flashbacks and backstory contextualizing the deep ideological conflict that culminated in violence and the division of Korea. The second novel, Arirang, is technically a prequel to Taebaek Mountain Range, and covers the Japanese colonial period of Korean history.One of the primary themes in Jo Jeong-rae's work, concern regarding the socio-economic roots of the division of Korea and the search for Korean reunification, is also present in his other, shorter works of fiction, particularly his later works, such as \"Sorrow, That Shaded Place\" (\ud55c \uadf8 \uadf8\ub298\uc758 \uc790\ub9ac), \"Land of Exile\" (\uc720\ud615\uc758 \ub545), \"Human Stairs\" (\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uacc4\ub2e8), and \"The Soul of a Barren Land\" (\ubc15\ud1a0\uc758 \ud63c). Many of his earlier works, however, such as \"A Woman from Cheongsan\" (\uccad\uc0b0\ub301), \"The Violent Instructor\" (\ud401\ub140\uc11d \uad50\uc0ac), \"The Shaded Slope\" (\ube44\ud0c8\uc9c4 \uc74c\uc9c0), \"The Age of Geocentrism\" (\ucc9c\ub3d9\uc124 \uc2dc\ub300), and \"Foreign Land\" (\uc774\ubc29\uc9c0\ub300), tend to reconstruct stories of traditional rustic life, targeting and satirizing the various absurdities of life in a much more general fashion.\n",

In 1998, the family moved to Chuncheon. After his sister stopped playing the piano in 2004, Jo's mother turned her full attention to the musical education of her son, which he considers to be a turning point in his life.In 2006, he was admitted to Seoul Arts High School, then in 2009, he started his education at Seoul National University, studying vocal music. He participated in several singing competitions, where he became a semi-finalist, finalist or winner. In 2011, he became the youngest finalist of the DongA Music Competition. This year he lent his singing voice to actor Lee David in the war film The Front Line.During this period, he became unsure of his future, as he failed to win several competitions and received harsh criticism. In 2013, he decided to further his studies at Seoul National University's graduate school. Here, he found new inspiration under the supervision of opera singer and university professor Kwangchul Youn. He also gave singing lessons at the university dorm. He started working for the Seoul Metropolitan Opera and participated in various stages.In 2015, he was a semi-finalist at the Montreal International Musical Competition, after which he started his compulsory military service as a conscripted policeman.  In 2016, at the Geneva International Music Competition, he was told he would not be able to get lead singing roles in opera, due to his light leggero tone. This shook his view of his future and considered quitting singing when he came across the first season of Phantom Singer and decided to apply for the second season. He thought crossover music might be a viable solution for his voice type.During the competition, Jo selected Ko Woo-rim for the 2nd round of the competition and trained him. Then, he selected Bae Doo-hoon for the 3rd round of the competition to add variety to the team color. In the final competition, Kang Hyung-ho joined the team.

In 2009, she graduated from Southeastern High School in Detroit, playing basketball at the junior varsity level. She then attended Saginaw Valley State University and studied nursing for three semesters before deciding to focus full-time on her music career.\nIn 2011, Dej Loaf began her career as a hip hop artist. Her stage name is a portmanteau of a shortened version of her first name, \"Deja\", and \"loafer\", as she took a keen interest in Air Jordans when growing up. In 2013, she released her first official mixtape, Just Do It.. That mixtape attracted the attention of a fellow Detroit-native rapper SAYITAINTTONE. She was later signed to his indie record label, called IBGM (I Been Gettin' Money) under his management team. In July 2014, she released her track, called \"Try Me\" (produced by DDS), as a single, which earned her viral popularity.  Canadian hip hop recording artist Drake quoted lyrics from the song in his Instagram post. In October 2014, she signed a major record deal to Columbia Records. After signing the deal, she released her second official mixtape, called Sell Sole.

As an undergraduate, she conducted research under Prof. Vernon Ingram on peptides that ameliorate amyloid beta neurotoxicity.She then went on to graduate studies at the California Institute of Technology, where she studied novel coordination chemistry and small molecule reactivity with Prof. Jonas C. Peters. Lu's doctoral work focused on the reactivity of zwitterionic palladium(II) complexes with CO, ethylene and amines, as well as tetrahedral manganese complexes and reductive cleavage of CO2 with an iron(I) complex. She earned her Ph.D. in 2006, with a thesis entitled The Chemistry of Tris(phosphino)borate Manganese and Iron Platforms.Lu conducted postdoctoral studies at the Max Planck Institute for Bioinorganic Chemistry from 2006 to 2009, under the mentorship of Prof. Karl Wieghardt. Under Wieghardt, Lu studied first-row transition metal complexes synthesized with redox non-innocent \u03b1-iminopyridine ligands. Lu also reported the synthesis and characterization of a chromium iminyl radical complex, using the \u03b1-iminopyridine ligand system.\nIn 2009, Lu began her independent career at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities as an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry. She was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 2015, and full Professor in 2020.Her research focuses on the synthesis and characterization of bimetallic complexes, especially those that contain a metal-metal bond. The Lu group has developed a series of trianionic, tripodal ligands that can coordinate two metals at close proximity, allowing for the formation for a metal-metal bond in a coordination complex. The metal-metal bond order can range from bond orders of less than one to a quintuple bond, as between manganese and chromium in a complex reported in 2013, and between two chromium atoms in a complex reported in 2015.These coordination complexes are also active for catalytic reactions of small molecules, such as the silylation of nitrogen by a dicobalt complex, and alkene hydrogenation by nickel-group 13 element complexes.\n",

His mother was a lover and collector of Western jazz records, which sparked a similar\u2014if not greater\u2014musical interest within Lu at a very young age. The glimmer of Lu's talent was apparent as he would belt out the songs of Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson only after listening to them once or twice.  Lu's grandmother also contributed to his musical versality. His grandmother was a fan of local Taiwanese dramas and would sing theme songs from these dramas to Lu and his sister to coax them to sleep. It was most likely at this time that Lu developed his signature style- carefree, sincere, and youthful.\nAfter graduating from the Tainan Guangming High School in 2003, Lu moved north to Taipei to attend Tamkang University. Although he intended on majoring in electrical engineering, due to his near fatal car accident, Lu was forced to switch his major to Spanish Literature.\nIn his first year at Tamkang University, Lu was run over by a bus and suffered severe injuries in both legs. As a result, Lu spent months in the hospital, during which he picked up the guitar and experimented with musical composition. The following year, Lu won first prize for musical composition and solo performance at a Tamkang University singing contest and proceeded to once again take the gold in composition and to become the crowd favorite at a similar contest at National Chengchi University. Lu caught the eye, and ears, of prominent music record producer Zhong Cheng Hu, and, with Zhong, produced three singles.  Of them, \"Good Morning, Beautiful Dawn!\" appeared on the Taiwan Musical Society's Top Ten Singles in 2007. By mere word of mouth, Lu sold 15,000 CD's of his singles.\nIn late 2006, for a little more than a year, Lu toured all of Taiwan, hopping from diners to universities, and created a huge following, especially among university students.\nIn 2008, Lu ended his tour with 100 concerts and, on 25 May, came out with his first CD 100 Ways of Living. Filled with the simple honesty of everyday life, 100 Ways of Living topped the charts and altered the course of the heavily Mando-pop musical industry and taste in all of Asia dramatically.\nOn 23 August 2008, Lu had his own first official concert, only 88 days after his hit CD came out.\nIn 2009, Lu's albums Seven Days (\u4e03\u5929) and Live in Taipei International Convention Center (TICC) were both awarded one of the Top 10 Selling Mandarin Albums of the Year at the 2009 IFPI Hong Kong Album Sales Awards, presented by the Hong Kong branch of IFPI.Lu performed the  theme song of the film Your Name Engraved Herein,  the piece won Best Original Film Song at Taiwan's Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards.

He worked for several years on advertising assignments before going freelance as a reportage photographer. During his years of study at Tsinghua University, Lu encountered Xie Hairong, another Chinese photographer, from whom he gained inspiration to become a photojournalist.\nLu's work covers a wide range of consequences of China's rapid industrialization. A reoccurring theme is that of \"cancer villages\" in certain affected provinces, the negative environmental conditions (such as water pollution) causing these cancer villages and other related health issues, and the effect of industrialization on Chinese countrysides and its people. Lu has stated that his choice of subject in his photography is done to raise awareness in both China and on a global scale.\nShanxi province is the setting for a photograph within the series capturing severe birth defects present in the children living there.
