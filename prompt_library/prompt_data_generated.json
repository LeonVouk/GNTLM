In 1966, while studying his PhD at Nagoya, he developed the earliest concepts for what would later become known as linear predictive coding (LPC), along with Shuzo Saito from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT). They described an approach to automatic phoneme discrimination that involved the first maximum likelihood approach to speech coding. In 1968, he joined the NTT Musashino Electrical Communication Laboratory in Tokyo. The same year, Itakura and Saito presented the Itakura\u2013Saito distance algorithm. The following year, Itakura and Saito introduced partial correlation (PARCOR) to LPC.Itakura completed his D.Eng. degree in speech processing in 1972, writing his dissertation on \"Speech Analysis and Synthesis based on a Statistical Method.\"\nFrom 1973 to 1975, he worked at the Acoustics Research Department of Bell Labs, having  been invited to work there on fundamental problems by James Flanagan, who had been impressed by  one of Itakura's papers on low bit-rate encoding.In 1975, Itakura developed the line spectral pairs (LSP) method for high-compression speech coding, while at NTT. From 1975 to 1981, he studied problems in speech analysis and synthesis based on the LSP method. In 1980, his team developed an LSP-based speech synthesizer chip. LSP is an important technology for speech synthesis and coding, and in the 1990s was adopted by almost all international speech coding standards as an essential component, contributing to the enhancement of digital speech communication over mobile channels and the internet worldwide.In 1981, he was appointed as Chief of the Speech and Acoustics Research Section at NTT.

His parents had travelled to England in 1936, where his father was an inventor and engineer who created the Ifield fuel pump, for Lucas Industries, which was used in jet aircraft.The Ifield family returned to Australia in January 1948 aboard the Orion. They lived near Dural, 50 km (31 mi) north-west of Sydney. It was a rural district and he listened to hillbilly music (later called country music) while milking the family's cow. He was given a guitar in 1949 by his grandmother and was self-taught; he also taught himself to yodel, by imitating country stars, including Hank Snow.The family moved to Beecroft, a Sydney suburb. At the age of 13 he performed his version of Bill Showmet's \"Did You See My Daddy Over There?\" and appeared on local radio station 2GB's talent quest, Amateur Hour. This track was issued as his first single, in 1953, by Regal Zonophone Records. By November of that year he appeared regularly on Brisbane radio station, 4BK's Youth Parade, playing guitar and singing, where, \"All the artists in this programme are under 21 year of age.\"His third single was a cover version of \"Abdul Abulbul Amir\" (September 1954), which was backed by his own composition, \"A Mother's Faith\". In 1956 he hosted, Campfire Favourites, on local TV station, TCN-9, which \"was the first weekly 'Western' programme by a local artist on Australian television.\" From that year to late 1957 he recorded six singles with a backing group, Dick Carr Buckaroos.In 1957 he recorded a track, \"Whiplash\", which was used as the theme song for the British/Australian TV series of the same title from September 1960 to mid-1961. He toured the North Island of New Zealand in early 1959, where his single, \"Guardian Angel\", reached No. 1 on local radio charts. Ifield had two top 30 hits in that year on the Kent Music Report, with \"True\" (September, No. 26) and \"Teenage Baby\" (November, No. 23). He returned to the United Kingdom in November 1959.\nIfield married Gillian Bowden, a dancer at the London Palladium, on 6 July 1965 at Marylebone Register, London. Ifield starred as Dave Kelly, and Bowden appeared as a dancer, in the comedy musical film, Up Jumped a Swagman (December 1965).  The couple had two children.In 1986, Ifield  contracted pneumonia and required surgery to remove part of a lung. As a result, his vocal cords were damaged, which meant he could not sing or yodel for years until they recovered. He and Bowden divorced in 1988 and he returned to Sydney to live. In 1992, he married his second wife, Carole Wood, an airline hostess.\n",

Reading continues to focus on Southern Hemisphere continental lithosphere, with emphasis on Australia and Antarctica, and technique development in seismology and computational physical sciences.\nReading's career includes multiple field seasons in Antarctica and Australia which expanded the seismic data available for these regions through the deployment of temporary networks of instruments. Using seismic energy as a means of learning about hidden regions of the continents, her work demonstrated the association between the structure of continents at depth, and the history of plate tectonics for that region.In 2014, she led research at the University of Tasmania that developed earthquake technology to track deep ocean storms, which \"play a key role in global climate\". Reading also uses seismology to understand the interaction between glaciers and the bedrock beneath, and coordinates community initiatives in interdisciplinary Antarctic science.Reading was an early pioneer of computational methods that apply machine learning to geoscience data. This has greatly expanded the analysis toolbox for geophysicists in both fundamental and applied research areas. Such approaches have an added benefit of being able to integrate numerical and categorical data in multivariate syntheses.

Subsequently, Ko joined the faculty of Tamkang University. In 2008, she was named dean of student affairs at Tamkang.\nIn November 2015, Ko was placed second on the Kuomintang party list, immediately following longtime legislator Wang Jin-pyng, regarded as part of the safe list, ensuring electoral victory. She arrived at the Legislative Yuan to take office on 1 February 2016, with a group of Tamkang students. Shortly after Ko was seated, the Kuomintang asked her to open an office in Pingtung County. She served as convener of the legislative education committee between February 2017 and March 2018, later leading the KMT's women's department. In May 2017, Ko joined the Renewable Power Promotion Alliance founded by Mary Chen.As a legislator, Ko took an interest in education, LGBT rights, women's rights, pension reform, and energy. She was supportive of many cultural exchanges between Taiwan and other countries, namely China. Soon after taking office, she co-signed a bill proposed by Karen Yu to allow young children into the legislative chamber. In March 2018, Ko remarked that customs deemed discriminatory toward women should be phased out. She approached pension reform from a schoolteacher's perspective, proposing that the monthly pension be capped at NT$32,160, and suggested that pensions be withheld from retired public servants that took positions at government funded agencies willing to pay half of their former salary.Ko drew attention to corruption on private school boards, the labor rights of graduate students, funding for internships, and policies affecting foreign students. She took an interest in student safety, and to this end, helped pass stricter restrictions on cram school instructors. In November 2017, Ko advised James C. Liao and others affiliated with Academia Sinica to resign from National Taiwan University's presidential selection committee to avoid a conflict of interest, as two candidates under consideration were Academia Sinica's then- and former vice president. When Kuan Chung-ming was named NTU president, Ko pushed the Ministry of Education to confirm his election, though Kuan was also suspected of a conflict of interest.Upon completing her term in the Legislative Yuan, Ko returned to her professorship within Tamkang University's Graduate Institute of Educational Psychology and Counseling and concurrently headed the National Policy Foundation, a Kuomintang think tank.

Xavier would also trek over by bus to a place near the commercial hub of Karachi where there would be rejected publications, and buy guitar player magazines- the only source for information on music available at the time.\nXavier did not have many friends, so when he discovered one other person in his neighborhood, Ovais, who was apart from the rest like himself, he found someone equally involved and determined about learning as much as possible about music and musicians internationally. Before long, some of Xavier's school friends from Saint Paul's English High School also started learning various instruments, and when Xavier was 14, they formed a band.

From a young age, she was deeply fascinated by medieval European paraphernalia, and with the influence from foreign juvenile novel series such as the Bartimaeus Sequence, The Saga of Darren Shan, and The Seventh Tower, Kobashiri decided to become a fantasy novelist.When she submitted her work for the 15th Dengeki Novel Prize, it reached the second round before being rejected. A few years later, Kobashiri's submission to a female-orientated label reached the final round. Under the name Koketa Kobashiri (\u864e\u8d70\u3053\u3051\u305f, Kobashiri Koketa), she submitted Grimoire of Zero for the 20th Dengeki Novel Prize and won it. After changing her pen name to Kakeru Kobashiri, she debuted as a novelist under this name on 10 February 2014. Grimoire of Zero received a manga adaptation in December of the same year, in October 2015 a spinoff manga started publishing, and the series received an anime adaptation in 2017. Grimoire of Zero finished publishing in December 2017 with 11 volumes.\nIn August 2018, under Kodansha's LIGHT NOVEL imprint, Kobashiri started publishing a sequel to her previous work called The Dawn of the Witch. Just like its predecessor, it received a manga adaptation and an anime adaptation was announced in 2021.In 2019, she was in-charge of writing the main scenario for the mobile game Kurosu \u00d7 Rogusu (\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u00d7\u30ed\u30b4\u30b9).\nKobashiri has said she enjoys royal road adventure stories and romantic comedies, and that Grimoire was her way of writing a combination of both. Being that Grimoire had a therianthropic protagonist and her work generally being filled with such characters, many speculate that Kobashiri particularly enjoys kemonomimi. However, she denies this rumor, stating \"what interests her most is the dynamic found in human-nonhuman relationships\" which she says extends to human-robot and human-monster relationships also. Kobashiri likes video games, and reading children's literature, picture books, manga, and movies, and has stated that Grimoire was influenced by novels such as The Lord of the Rings, The Saga of Darren Shan, Kino's Journey, and Slayers, as well as manga such as Bastard!! and Berserk. As a technical high school graduate, where she was the only female student in her class, she says she cannot write novels based on school life.In describing her how she writes, Kobashiri says that she first creates the characters before molding the setting and storyline around them. In addition, she says she is always conscious of her prose's rhythm and the tempo of her story, being careful not to distract the reader with minutiae, especially during dialogue, and avoids using difficult words and kanji as much as possible.\n",

His former club Iskra Bugojno had made a complaint to the Yugoslav FA claiming he was still their player, and Vojvodina claimed that Red Star had no right to use Zjajo as the FA did not rule out any decision about whose player Zjajo was.

His first contact with Brazilian music was back in his hometown Seattle, through Brazilian musician and professor Jovino Santos Neto and Jeff Busch, who invited him for a batucada. At that time, Bo had no knowledge on Brazilian music, but Neto taught him a couple of things, starting his relationship with the genres from that country. He then started to make musical trips around the World - one of them saw him going from Cairo to Cape Town in a 20-country tour, hence the strong African influences in his works. The first movement which caught his attention was the Senegalese hip hop. Such trips to Africa resulted in his first full-length solo album, Archipelagoes, recorded entirely in that content and released in 2008.His earliest releases were collaborative albums with Filastine: the first came in 2001 and consisted of Indian, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan music works recorded between 1997-1999. In 2005 came Lost & Stolen Goods (2005), a live mix by the same duo, but then known as Sonar Calibrado.His first solo work was the EP Tudo Bem, released in 2003 via Tru Thoughts.

In 1996, she received her Bachelors of Science in biochemistry and molecular biology.Hu then moved to the United States to work as a research technician for one year at the University of California, San Francisco. She then pursued her graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley. Under the mentorship of Corey S. Goodman, Hu explored the role of the plexin receptor and the Rho family GTPases in central nervous system development in Drosophila. Plexins are receptors involved in axon guidance, and Hu discovered a seven amino acid sequence in plexin, PlexB, which is necessary for Rac-GTP binding and subsequently axon guidance. Interestingly, PlexB inhibits Rac from binding downstream interactors while at the same time enhancing RhoA activity, altogether driving axon guidance. In further work, Hu found that CrossGAP, a GTPase-activating protein, is responsible for regulating Rac dependent-cytoskeletal changes during axon guidance in Drosophila. Hu completed her PhD in 2002.Following her PhD, Hu pursued her postdoctoral work under the mentorship of Julius Zhu and Roberto Malinow at the University of Virginia. In 2004, Hu moved to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and then to the University of California, San Diego in 2006, to continue working under the mentorship of Malinow. During her postdoc, Hu explored the role of AMPA receptor trafficking in emotional enhancement of memory formation as well as the role of Ras GTPase signalling in fragile X syndrome.\nIn 2008, Hu returned to China and joined the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai and became the principal investigator of the Hu Lab. Her lab has been focusing on the neural mechanisms of social dominance in mice as well as the neural mechanisms of depression and the antidepressant effects of ketamine.

In 1968 he graduated in Classical Literature at the Catholic University of Milan, where he subsequently worked for two years as assistant lecturer of History of Religion. Later he was appointed professor of literature and history at a Milanese High School, an activity that he continued for almost thirty years and that would influence several of his songs.\nHis career in the Italian music industry began in the late 1960s as songwriter for Italian pop stars such as Ornella Vanoni, Gigliola Cinquetti, Mina, Iva Zanicchi and the band Nuovi Angeli. Vecchioni's first solo album, Parabola was released in 1971. In 1973 he took part in the Sanremo Festival with \"L'uomo che si gioca il cielo a dadi\". His 1974 LP,  Il re non si diverte, won the Best Year's Album Award from the Italian music critic. In 1976 he released Elisir. Vecchioni's breakthrough happened in 1977 with Samarcanda, an album where he drew inspiration mostly from autobiographical themes, intermingled with dreamy, literary, historical and mythological references. Angelo Branduardi played violin on the LP.\nVecchioni's skills were confirmed in the following works, Calabuig, Stranamore e altri incidenti (1978), where the literary citations predominated, and in Robinson (1979), where instead the autobiographical inspiration prevails. The songs \"Signor giudice\" and \"Lettera da Marsala\" of the latter work deal with the problems Vecchioni had had in the preceding years: respectively, a charge for marijuana possession (from which he was acquitted) and a dispute with his former record label. The following album, Montecristo, was released indeed by both the old and the new labels.\nAfter Hollywood Hollywood of 1982, whose songs are influenced by the world of cinema, Vecchioni in 1984 released the double LP Il grande sogno (\"The Great Dream\"), in which he collected new songs together with new versions of his past hits. The title track featured Francesco De Gregori playing blues harp. The LP was accompanied by his first literary attempt, a short book with the same name. Many of the cover of Vecchioni's LPs of this period were created by the famous Italian comic book artist and painter Andrea Pazienza.\nWhile continuing a successful career as a renowned singer-songwriter in the 1980s and the 1990s, Vecchioni spent more time writing. His prose includes the collection Viaggi nel tempo immobile (1996) and the novels Le parole non-portano le cicogne (2000) and Il libraio di Selinunte. He also lectured on the History of Italian Songwriting in a tour lasting two years, and was called to author the Enciclopedia Treccani article about Italian singer-songwriters. His best more recent works include Sogna ragazzo sogna (\"Dream, boy, dream\") of 1999 and Il lanciatore di coltelli (\"The Knife Thrower\") of 2002.\nOn 19 February 2011, he won the 61st Sanremo Music Festival and the \"Mia Martini\" Critics' Award with the song \"Chiamami ancora amore\" (\"Call me Love again\").\n",

With the publication of his novel Han River (\ud55c\uac15, 2002), Jo Jeong-rae finally completed his trilogy of works dedicated to modern Korean history. Sales of the series reached record-breaking numbers in South Korea, selling over 10 million copies.The epic historical trilogy, begun in 1983 and eventually completed in 2002, comprises Jo Jeong-rae's three most well-known novels: Taebaek Mountain Range, Arirang, and Han River. Each novel is over ten volumes in length, and each deals with different aspects of the turbulent history of Korea in the modern era. The first novel, Taebaek Mountain Range, examines the five-year period between the liberation of Korea from Japanese colonial rule in 1945 to the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, with detailed flashbacks and backstory contextualizing the deep ideological conflict that culminated in violence and the division of Korea. The second novel, Arirang, is technically a prequel to Taebaek Mountain Range, and covers the Japanese colonial period of Korean history.One of the primary themes in Jo Jeong-rae's work, concern regarding the socio-economic roots of the division of Korea and the search for Korean reunification, is also present in his other, shorter works of fiction, particularly his later works, such as \"Sorrow, That Shaded Place\" (\ud55c \uadf8 \uadf8\ub298\uc758 \uc790\ub9ac), \"Land of Exile\" (\uc720\ud615\uc758 \ub545), \"Human Stairs\" (\uc778\uac04\uc758 \uacc4\ub2e8), and \"The Soul of a Barren Land\" (\ubc15\ud1a0\uc758 \ud63c). Many of his earlier works, however, such as \"A Woman from Cheongsan\" (\uccad\uc0b0\ub301), \"The Violent Instructor\" (\ud401\ub140\uc11d \uad50\uc0ac), \"The Shaded Slope\" (\ube44\ud0c8\uc9c4 \uc74c\uc9c0), \"The Age of Geocentrism\" (\ucc9c\ub3d9\uc124 \uc2dc\ub300), and \"Foreign Land\" (\uc774\ubc29\uc9c0\ub300), tend to reconstruct stories of traditional rustic life, targeting and satirizing the various absurdities of life in a much more general fashion.\n",
        "output": "Jo Jeong-rae's early interest in literature, winning competitions in elementary school, and his decision to major in Korean literature at Dongguk University influenced his decision to become an author. The success and recognition of his popular novels, such as Taebaek Mountain Range and Arirang, further solidified his dedication to a career in literature. Additionally, Jo Jeong-rae's exploration of themes related to Korean history, division, and reunification in his works played a significant role in shaping his decision to devote his entire life to writing.\n                        This person should become: author\n                        "

He stated that genetic testing determined that he has Yakut and Buryat ancestry as well.When he was five years old, he moved with his parents to Fullerton, California. His mother later told People magazine that prior to the move Seagal was frail and suffered from asthma: \"He was a puny kid back then. But he really thrived after the move [from Michigan].\" Seagal attended Buena Park High School in Buena Park, California, and Fullerton College between 1970 and 1971.

His given name \"Songfen\" comes from a passage  of the 3rd-century treatise Wen fu written by Lu Ji.In 1935, Gu Tinglong accepted a job at the Yenching University library, and moved the family to Beijing. Two years later, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out and Japanese warplanes bombed the Xiyuan Barracks of the Chinese 29th Army on 28 July 1937. As the Gu family lived near the barracks, their house was shaken by the explosions. Songfen recalled watching the bombs fall out of the planes, before adults urged him to hide under the dining table. He attributes this experience as the main reason he decided to become an aircraft designer.To escape Japanese occupation, in 1938 Gu Tinglong moved the family to the Shanghai French Concession, where he helped establish the United Library (\u5408\u4f17\u56fe\u4e66\u9986). After the end of the war, Songfen graduated from high school in 1947 and entered National Chiao Tung University, Shanghai to study aeronautical engineering.\nGu graduated from university in 1951, and was assigned to work for the newly established Aviation Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, under China's top aircraft designers Xu Shunshou and Huang Zhiqian. The People's Republic of China (PRC), which had just been founded two years earlier, was still establishing its aviation industry, and in the early years Gu mostly worked on servicing Soviet-made aircraft.In August 1956, the Aviation Industry Bureau established the PRC's first airplane design office in Shenyang, with Xu Shunshou as its director, Huang Zhiqian and Ye Zhengda as deputy directors. Gu, then 26 years old, was appointed head of the aerodynamics group. The office's first task was to design and build a jet trainer, the Shenyang JJ-1. The plane took its first flight on 26 July 1958, which marked a new era of China's aviation industry.\nGu was transferred to Beijing in 1986 to serve as Deputy Director of the national government's Aviation Industry and Technology Commission. In this capacity, he participated in planning the future development of China's aviation industry. In June 2001, Gu, Wang Daheng, Shi Changxu and more than a dozen other scientists proposed the development of China's own jetliner. The proposal was adopted by the Chinese government in 2007, and the Comac C919 took its maiden flight ten years later, on 5 May 2017.Gu was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1991, and of the Chinese Academy of Engineering in 1994.

Initially planning on a path in politics, she interned for congressmen and senators on Capitol Hill, and then worked as a press assistant on Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.\nIn 2009, an assignment in an elective art class at Vassar College sparked Meade's curiosity. She decided to explore space and light through the idea of putting black paint on the ground where the shadows were cast.

In so doing, she realized that she had made the three-dimensional form appear to be a two-dimensional painting.\nThe results of these experiments changed her perspective and inspired her to reevaluate her career goals.

Wales & Celtic midfielder Joe Ledley who is also a close friend of Gabbidon, has also called for the West Ham man to return to the international fold.

So I was discouraged from writing and embarrassed.\" Even though it was clear that she had an affinity for crafting stories, her dyslexia stalled any possible writing career through most of the 1970s. It was not until a teacher spotted a pattern in Flagg's misspelled written answers on Match Game and sent her a note that she understood she had a learning disability; Flagg later stated she had not heard of the condition prior to this note. Eventually, Flagg was able to overcome her fear associated with the disorder and has since completed several novels.In the mid-1970s, Flagg shared a house in Charlottesville, Virginia  with American writer Rita Mae Brown, whom she met at a party in the Hollywood Hills hosted by Marlo Thomas. According to Brown, Flagg also lived for eight years with former The Bold and the Beautiful actress Susan Flannery.\n",

She says that the subject of cinema combined all her interests, in \"writing, photography, music... together in one art form\".\nIn 2003, Qu returned to Beijing, in order to become a film producer, and to pursue her interest in helping independent filmmakers. She says that she became aware that whilst filmmakers in China have good ideas and scripts, they lack the resources to produce or market their films for an international audience. In 2007, she began producing films in collaboration with Chinese film director  Diao Yi'Nan, and first produced Night Train, the story of a young, widowed prison guard who takes a night train to a dating service, as she feels lonely and isolated. The film was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. The following year, she produced the film Knitting, a romantic drama told from a female perspective and based on the Chinese myth of the cowherd and the weaver girl, as told in the Qixi Festival. In 2013, she produced Longing for the Rain, the story of a woman living in a loveless marriage until a man appears in her dreams, and with whom she finds she cannot live without.As Qu was working creatively with film directors in her role as film producer, she also decided to try to direct. Her debut feature as director, Trap Street, made in 2013, tells the story of a young digital map-maker who finds his computerised maps have been mysteriously altered after he becomes infatuated with a young woman working for China's intelligence service, in a street which does not officially exist. Qu says that the film reflects a changing reality in modern China, in which people have started to notice \"little things that are happening\", such as \"the Internet and text messages being censored all the time\", with social media services such as Facebook routinely inaccessible. She also says that people are detained by the authorities for apparently minor infractions, such as keying in particular words on search engines. However, she says that, despite such perceptions, for most of the younger generation in China, who did not live through such periods as the Cultural Revolution, \"this is something completely new\", and that they don't understand why it is happening.

In 2005 Vogel was appointed a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas at Austin.\nVogel was appointed as an assistant professor at the New York University in 2011. Vogel has studied the mechanisms involved with protein signalling. The creation of proteins involve messenger RNA molecules from the genes encoded within DNA. Both the generation of RNA and formation of proteins are coupled to one another, akin to the coupling of a moving escalator with someone walking upon it. Vogel has shown that both processes, the generation of RNA and the arrangement of RNA into proteins, are important. She demonstrated that the process of generating RNA from DNA is pulsed-like: brief spikes of activity that relax to a ground state, whereas the creation of proteins was more like an on-off switch.Vogel is interested in how genes respond to different stressors and how certain environmental conditions can give rise to mutations such as cancer. Amongst these genes, Vogel has studied BRCA1, which, if functioning properly, can prevent cells from dividing or growing. Mutations on the BRCA1 means that damage to DNA cannot be repaired, such that cells mutate and cause cancer. Vogel believes that by understanding the pathways involved with these processes she will be able to design drugs to counter this BRCA1 mutation.

One year was spent as a foreign exchange student at Huntington Park High School in Huntington Park, California. Prep school was followed by Diocesan College, from which he matriculated in 1966. He has earned an MBChB (1974), MD (1981), and DSc (Med) (2002).\nIn 1980 Noakes was tasked to start a sports science course at the University of Cape Town.  Noakes went on to head the Medical Research Council-funded Bioenergetics of Exercise Research Unit, which was later changed to the MRC/UCT Research Unit for Exercise Science and Sports Medicine.In the early 1990s Noakes co-founded the Sports Science Institute of South Africa, with former South African rugby player Morne du Plessis.\nHe is a leading researcher on the condition now known as exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH). He first recognised this condition in a female runner during the 1984 Comrades Marathon, and published his findings in 1985 in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise. Noakes wrote the consensus statement for the 1st International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference in Cape Town in May 2005.\nIn 1996 Noakes published his theory of the \"central governor\". The theory proposed that fatigue is a \"protective emotion\" rather than a physiological state.Noakes served on the selection panel for the International Olympic Committee\u2019s Science Prize between 1995 and 2002. Noakes is a fellow of the American College of Sports Medicine.\nIn 2005 he undertook a series of experiments in the Arctic and Antarctic on South African (British-born) swimmer Lewis Gordon Pugh to understand human capability in extreme cold.  He discovered that Pugh had the ability to raise his core body temperature before entering the water in anticipation of the cold and coined the phrase 'anticipatory thermo-genesis' to describe it.

Although \"Trash\" was a fairly mainstream ballad, the rest of the EP showed a continuity with her indie past. Lo would later ditch Keith Chan and Wyman Wong who had a dominant presence on the EP to work with entirely different songwriters and lyricists for her debut album. Released in late 1998, Lo's first full-length solo album was titled Miao, which referred to her love of cats and how \"they listen while people sometimes don't.\"Miao was apparently released to \"more than disappointing\" album sales and low radio airplay, with producer Kubert Leung remarking that the public had \"failed to grasp the concept of the album.\"Lo's second album, Getting Closer to Candy Lo (\u8cbc\u8fd1\u76e7\u5de7\u97f3) (1999), represented a more conscious attempt to connect with a mainstream audience, while retaining a sense of the unique individualism found in Miao. The album continued to set Lo's music apart from the mainstream. It contained five of her compositions, including the single \"Regeneration,\" (\u65b0\u9673\u4ee3\u8b1d) which was influenced by 70's art rock. Upon release, the album garnered her some comparisons as \"Hong Kong's Faith Yang\". Art direction for the album was done by William Chang.\nA substantially more commercial direction was signalled by the release of 2002's Appreciating the Taste of Life (\u8cde\u5473\u4eba\u9593), which gave Lo her first-ever smash hit, \"Please Break Up\" (\u597d\u5fc3\u5206\u624b). The song topped the charts and won her year-end awards at all four of Hong Kong's major radio and TV stations, making it a career highlight for Lo. A duet version of the song was recorded with Taiwan singer Leehom Wang to accompany the second edition of the album. The song remains one of the most frequently requested songs at Hong Kong karaoke bars to this day.\nIn May 2003, Lo held her first stadium concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum, True Music 1st Flight Live 2003, performing for two nights.
